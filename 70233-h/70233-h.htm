<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Old</span> Lord Madeley had taken unto himself
a wife—one of the beautiful Sisters Alvarez
of the Pavilion Theatre of Varieties
and the other West-end halls. Whereat
the world of Society wondered for ten days.
His relatives never ceased to wonder.</p>

<p>He was always called “Old Lord Madeley,”
but as a matter of fact he had but
turned the half-century some four or five
years previously. The man and his history
were curious. The twenty-fifth holder of
the ancient Barony of Madeley, he was a
legitimate scion of the Plantagenets and an
illegitimate one of the Stuarts; and he had
been born the youngest child of his parents’
marriage.</p>

<p>In these later times the ancient and historic
houses of Norman England have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
fallen upon impoverished days, and a
younger son succeeds to but a pittance.
The land is there for the eldest, but each
generation leaves it more burdened than
did its predecessor, and there is little if
any margin realisable in hard cash.</p>

<p>Such a pittance had been the fortune to
which Charles de Bohun Fitz Aylwyn had
succeeded at the death of his father.
Hoarding his few poor hundreds per annum,
he had turned his back upon the
society into which he had been born, settled
himself in dingy lodgings in Bloomsbury,
and lapsed into an eccentric recluse, with
not a single thought beyond the study of the
science in which his soul delighted.</p>

<p>His eldest brother died childless after
a brief but brilliant reign, bequeathing
the whole of his personalty to his widow in
an attempt to increase the meagre jointure
which was her portion. In the realisation
of that personalty every stick of furniture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
and each single spoon in the old Manor
House, save the portraits on the walls, were
passed under the hammer of the auctioneer.
The second brother was an absentee landlord,
never going near his property, and
draining it to the last penny. Strangers
hired his house from him until he died.</p>

<p>At his death the title and estates passed
to Charles de Bohun, then and thereafter
twenty-fifth Baron Madeley in the peerage
of England.</p>

<p>With a mild curiosity his relatives and
the world at large wondered what on earth
he would do with the inheritance. For
months he never went near the place.</p>

<p>Then, without a word or hint of warning,
he left London, and travelled down
into Shropshire by the evening train. He
had never heard of slip coaches, he had forgotten
where an obsequious porter had told
him he would have to change, and at nine
o’clock at night he had been turned out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
the train at Shrewsbury, twenty miles beyond
his destination.</p>

<p>By the time the lumbering cab he engaged
at the railway station deposited him
at the Manor House, it was long past midnight.
After continuous knocking a sleepy
caretaker descended, only to open the door,
tell the visitor to be gone, and slam it in his
face. It had needed the thunderous assistance
of the cabman applied both to bell and
knocker and with boots upon the door panels
to recall the caretaker. Lord Madeley
had discharged him and his wife there and
then, and neither knew, cared, nor ever inquired
whether the couple left the house in
the darkness or waited until the following
day. Such had been the home-coming of
Lord Madeley.</p>

<p>Instructing his lawyers to refurnish the
house, engage servants, and appoint a
properly qualified agent to manage the estate,
Lord Madeley reorganised and required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
in his household a reversion and
rigid adherence to the studied solemnity
of state which he remembered from the
dignified days of his father and grandfather.
That he regarded as a duty attaching
to his rank, his caste, and his family.</p>

<p>Personally he remained wedded to his
pursuit of science, and continued his experiments
and investigations. A recluse
he had been in London—a recluse he remained
at Madeley, and for the first five
years of his enjoyment of the family heritage
he never once set foot outside the
doors of the Manor House. Absorbed in
science, his mind deep and recondite in
those directions, simple, straightforward,
and lovable in all the matters of a more
worldly nature, the old peer had probably
never given a thought to either any woman
in particular or to the female sex as a general
proposition. It is quite probable that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
it had never crossed Lord Madeley’s mind
that there really were two sexes, save as a
scientific proposition, of which scientific
proposition he, as a man of science, was
naturally cognisant. As a social problem
he had never thought of it, knew nothing
of it, and cared less.</p>

<p>But peers have obligations thrust upon
them, from which lesser mortals are exempt.
The exact circumstances which
had produced it are immaterial to the
story, but a royal command had left Lord
Madeley no alternative, and he had in
obedience thereto betaken himself to town.
That it was the first time he had recrossed
the threshold of the Manor House since he
had entered it was a thought which probably
never presented itself to his mind; and
that he was returning to the scenes in
which the greater part of his life had been
spent quickened his pulse not at all. He
was irked by the command, bored by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
anticipated absence of his scientific interests,
and, in the hope of avoiding ennui, he
cast about in his mind for a companion to
share with him the suite of apartments he
had engaged in the hotel at which his
father and grandfather before him had
been accustomed to sojourn whilst in town.
Probably for the first time in his life his
utter loneliness in the world made itself
manifest. He had one relative, and one
only, a young unmarried cousin, the son
of a distant cousin, and from the point of
pedigree the future head of the house of
Fitz Aylwyn.</p>

<p>Lord Madeley wrote and invited him.
The invitation was accepted.</p>

<p>Young Billy Fitz Aylwyn was one of
those men—there are such men—whom to
see was to like. Lord Madeley liked him
wholeheartedly, and, in the courteous attempt
to give pleasure to the younger man,
the old peer had consented to a tentative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
suggestion of his relative that they should
spend the evening by going to the Pavilion
Theatre. It was the first time Lord Madeley
had ever been inside a theatre. The
meretriciousness of things theatrical was
not laid bare to the old peer by reason of
experience and knowledge, and he was
fascinated by the beauty of the Alvarez
girls.</p>

<p>A passing comment on their beauty—for
they were beautiful, judged by any
standard—had provoked in the younger
of the men a confession of a personal acquaintance
with the sisters.</p>

<p>Absolutely in ignorance of the manner
of man Lord Madeley was, and thinking
the pure artistic admiration of classic
beauty was an interest of a totally different
kind, Fitz Aylwyn had suggested asking
the sisters to supper.</p>

<p>Lord Madeley, unsophisticated in the
ways of the world, and merely desiring to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
give pleasure to his relative and guest,
whom he supposed was putting himself out
to relieve the ennui of an old man, made no
objection, and the supper party had taken
place.</p>

<p>The Sisters Alvarez—Eulalie was the
elder and Dolores the younger—of pure
Spanish descent, but of entirely English
birth and domicile, were stars of the music-hall
world, but stars of no great or exceeding
magnitude. Calling themselves comediennes,
their turn was the usual song and
dance of no particular or more than average
merit. On the other hand, it was useless
to attempt to deny the fact that the sisters
were unquestionably the most beautiful
women upon the stage at that time. Descended
in a left-handed way from some
of the bluest blood of Andalusia, their
beauty had nothing in common with the
thick-lipped, teeth-displaying, plebeian
prettiness, which, by reason of picture postcard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
advertisement, one is now asked to believe
represents a type of the beauty of this
country.</p>

<p>Alike in feature, the two sisters were as
wide apart as the poles in character and
temperament. Eulalie, strong, compelling,
masterful, and passionate, controlled
the lives of both; Dolores, gentle, trusting,
and submissive, intensely admired her sister,
worshipped her ability, and did whatsoever
she was told.</p>

<p>The girls themselves—the outspoken
frankness of their world—the utter novelty
of the whole thing—the novelty of young
female society—the awe-struck deference
of the music-hall singer for a real peer of
England, who accorded to them the courtesy
and deference to women which he
vaguely recollected from the world of his
distant youth—interested Lord Madeley.</p>

<p>With charming but unsophisticated hospitality
he invited the sisters to visit the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
Manor House, thinking it an obligation of
hospitality owing by him to Fitz Aylwyn.
The invitation was accepted.</p>

<p>Eulalie, with a keen eye to opportunity,
made up her mind that the position of
Lady Madeley, mistress of the rent roll of
the great Manor of Madeley and of Madeley
Manor House, was within the possibilities.
She played for that position for all
she was worth, with every atom of knowledge
she possessed or could acquire, played
her game without the opposition of tangible
rivals, played her game as a clever and
beautiful woman of the world, knowing
every wile and every blandishment that
was permissible, played her game against
an old man to whom had been given no
weapon of defence and from whom had
been withheld the worldly knowledge out
of which such weapons could have been
fashioned and which would have indicated
their necessity. The result was never in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
doubt. Lord Madeley married, or was
married, as Eulalie had intended should
happen.</p>

<p>Let it here be said, for Lord Madeley
soon passes out of the story, that never for
one single instant did he ever regret his
marriage. Save that his house was better
ordered, his wishes more carefully respected,
his comfort more scrupulously
provided for, Lady Madeley was wise
enough to recognise that the ingrained
ways and habits of a lonely man of fifty-five
are fixed, and are altered only at the cost of
much discomfort. She contented herself
with the rank and position, the wealth, and
the house which the marriage had brought
her, and left Lord Madeley to pursue his
life as he inclined and much as he had done
theretofore. Two years after their marriage
their only child—a daughter, Consuelo—was
born, and a few years later Lord
Madeley died. Inertia, even if productive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
of a contented mind, is not especially
conducive to length of years.</p>

<p>His widow raised a costly marble monument
over his grave, mourned for a decently
prolonged interval, and re-emerged
in the world; whilst Consuelo, in her own
right Baroness Madeley, figured in her
father’s place in the peerage books.</p>

<p>But there had been an incident shortly
after the marriage which for some time
had thrown a blight upon the new-found
happiness of Lord and Lady Madeley.</p>

<p>Passing through London on their return
from a honey-moon spent upon the Continent,
Lady Madeley had visited on two occasions
her unmarried sister at the small
flat in Kensington which had been taken
for her and furnished by Lord Madeley.</p>

<p>The second visit was the last time the sisters
met. Two hours afterwards the maid
found the dead body of her mistress
stretched upon the bed in her room, stark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
nude, and on the table by the bedside an
opened half-bottle of champagne and a
glass from which some of the wine had
been drunk.</p>

<p>At the inquest which was held, however,
everything was made plain by the evidence
of the maid, who described the arrival of
Lady Madeley at the flat. She had prepared
and taken in tea, and had then been
sent to Bond Street to change the library
books and to purchase stalls at one of the
theatres, Lady Madeley having come to invite
her sister to spend the evening with her
husband and herself in that manner, and
having postponed the purchase of the stalls
until she had ascertained to which theatre
her sister would prefer to go.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_022a">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_022a.jpg" alt="The maid found the dead body of her mistress">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“The maid found the dead body of her mistress”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On her return from Bond Street, the
maid had found her mistress alone—Lady
Madeley having already left—and she described
how her mistress had at once sent
her out again to order a carriage from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
livery stables, and to purchase flowers and
gloves for that evening. When she returned
a second time she had found the
drawing-room empty, and the dead body
of her mistress lying naked upon the bed.</p>

<p>In cross-examination the maid had denied
having heard the least quarrelling between
the sisters, and could not suggest any
reason for her mistress having taken her
own life.</p>

<p>Lady Madeley, obviously deeply affected
by the tragic death of her sister, had corroborated
the evidence given by the maid;
and distinguished surgeons and analysts
had deposed the death to have been due to
prussic acid, and that the same poison could
be traced in the wine remaining in the
glass.</p>

<p>The coroner summed up, emphasising the
evidence which had been given, and which,
he remarked, pointed conclusively to suicide.
Alluding to the fact that the body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
was unclothed, the coroner added that he
thought the jury would find therein ample
justification for coming to the conclusion
that the mind of the deceased had become
unhinged. With such plain evidence of
fact before them he assumed the jury
would have no difficulty in arriving at a
verdict. If the evidence of the maid had
stood alone, they might well have had reason
for some hesitation and might have
wished to probe further into the matter for
a motive to account sufficiently for self-destruction.
But the maid had been for some
years in the employment of a family, members
of which had testified to the exemplary
character she bore, and her evidence was in
every way corroborated not only by Lady
Madeley, but also by witnesses from the library
in Bond Street, the livery stables, and
the other places to which she had been sent
by her mistress. There could be, therefore,
not the smallest suspicion attaching to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
the maid. As far as they were aware, the
only other visitor Miss Alvarez had had
that afternoon had been her sister, Lady
Madeley. Now, the evidence of the maid
had clearly established the fact that when
she returned on the first occasion Lady
Madeley had already gone, and the maid
then saw her mistress alive and spoke to
her. The only other alternative which remained
was that during the second absence
of the maid some unknown person had entered
the flat and had administered the poison.
That alternative could not be dismissed
as an impossibility. Miss Alvarez
was certainly alone in the flat at the time
when this might have occurred, but there
was much evidence which all tended to
negative the likelihood of such an explanation
being the correct one. For murder by
an unknown person to be the explanation,
motive, and a strong motive, became essential.
Robbery was disproved by the fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
that nothing whatever had been removed
from the flat, not even the purse which was
found lying on the table by the bedside;
nor the money, some six or seven pounds,
which still remained in the purse. That
disposed of any hypothetical stranger calling,
demanding money, being refused, and
committing a murder. Besides this, there
were no signs of any struggle. “Lady
Madeley,” the coroner continued, “has
told us of the intimate terms of affection
upon which she and her sister had always
lived; and Lady Madeley, out of her resulting
knowledge, has assured us that
there was nothing in her sister’s life, and no
one amongst her sister’s acquaintances, that
could provide or account for any sufficient
motive for such a crime. Of course, it is
common knowledge that Lady Madeley
and Miss Alvarez were, until very recently,
members of the theatrical profession; but
the many letters to Miss Alvarez, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
remained undestroyed in the flat, and
which have all been carefully examined,
the tone of those letters, and the evidence
we have had from so many artistes of the
high moral character both the sisters were
known in the profession to have, altogether
negative, and it gives me sincere pleasure
even on this sad and melancholy occasion
to say it, they emphatically negative any
supposition that there was an illicit side to
the life of Miss Alvarez to which we can
turn in the hope of an explanation. There
was no such side. Therefore, I think any
idea of murder may be dismissed. Motive,
of course, must always equally precede
self-destruction, but there motive need not
be that outside motive which must be
looked for, and for which logical explanation
must be found, where another person
is concerned to compass the death of a victim.
As I have already indicated, we have
some actual evidence of a disordered mind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
and such a mind would imagine and accept
as real quite non-existent facts and weave
those into a self-compelling motive. Every
fact that has been given in evidence is perfectly
compatible with suicide. There is
no fact within our knowledge which conflicts
with that supposition, there is no single
detail that raises any suspicion to the
contrary.”</p>

<p>Without hesitation the jury returned a
verdict of “Suicide during temporary insanity,”
a verdict with which the coroner
remarked that he entirely concurred.</p>

<p>Ashley Tempest, then a romantic but rising
young barrister, had been present at the
inquest, holding a watching brief which
had been sent him by the solicitors of Lord
Madeley. He had been fascinated by the
beauty of the dead woman whom several
times he happened to have seen and greatly
admired upon the stage. The little smile
which still seemed to play upon the lips,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
the long dark eyelashes resting upon her
cheeks, the profusion of long black hair,
the delicately chiselled features bit themselves
in upon his brain, and for days afterwards
the face with its haunting beauty
formed and reformed itself before his eyes,
no matter upon what he might be engaged.
The face threatened to become an obsession.
The dead mask was eliminating his
remembrance of the living woman, whereas
he would have had it otherwise; and partly
for that reason, but chiefly because it was
the first cause célèbre in which he had been
engaged, he purchased all the photographs
he could obtain of the dead actress, and,
sending them to a miniaturist, ordered a
miniature to be painted from them, and
hung it in his chambers.</p>

<p>As time passed slowly on, Tempest’s fascination
decreased; but through all his
busy life, amongst his multitudinous cases,
weird and mysterious as so many of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
were, he never forgot the strange story he
had heard unfolded at the inquest upon the
body of Dolores Alvarez. Many a night
when, pushing books and papers on one
side, he had lighted his final cigarette before
turning into bed, the miniature would
catch his eye, and, gazing again at the
beautiful face, his thoughts would revert
to the familiar story, and once again he
would puzzle over the facts he knew, in a
vain attempt to find a solution of the mystery.
Why had she poisoned herself? As
the succeeding years brought him fuller
knowledge of men and of women, and of
their motives, as case after case widened his
experience, so time after time would he
again place together the pieces of his puzzle,
arranging and rearranging them as
crime after crime passing through his
hands revealed to him new motives, new
characters, any one of which might prove
to be analogous and afford him the clue he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
wanted. Suicide it seemed plain enough
to him it must have been. He always remembered
how closely he had followed at
the time the reasoning of the coroner. He
always felt convinced it was logical and
conclusive, save in one little detail. Tempest
had started his legal career with a certain
fixed opinion concerning suicide which
he never altered—never had reason to alter—an
opinion that grew into conviction.
Suicide of itself he held never was and
never could be evidence of insanity. He
maintained his conviction in argument on
many occasions—at the Hardwicke—at
the Union—in the courts. He carried his
theory further, though not with equal certainty.
But he laid it down as a proposition,
yet to be disproved, that save in exceptional
cases an insane person never commits
suicide; and he confined those exceptional
cases to cases of previously provable delusions
of fact, which facts, if true, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
have created a logical and sane motive
sufficient to have resulted in the suicide of
a sane individual. He maintained that the
act of suicide was in itself a sane act, for
which cause was required to be shown, and
could always be shown if the facts in full
were available.</p>

<p>Such was the theory upon which he always
relied whenever in the course of his
profession he was brought face to face with
a necessity for the elucidation of a death.
He never found his theory at fault.
Tempted he often was at first sight to depart
from it, but always in the end the case
would prove but a renewed confirmation
of its accuracy.</p>

<p>Yet what was the motive which had
caused Dolores Alvarez to destroy herself?
Why did she do it? Why? And ever
would come that eternal Why? to which he
could suggest no answer.</p>

</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Understand</span> me once and for all,
Evangeline, I absolutely forbid it.”</p>

<p>Head in the air the girl walked out of
the room, slamming the door behind her.</p>

<p>Lady Stableford, thoroughly upset by
the discussion which had taken place, sank
into a low easy-chair and put her handkerchief
to her eyes. She had married her
husband at an early age, and had passed up
the social ladder with him, as a rapidly developing
business had increasingly provided
him with the wealth which had
opened the doors of Parliament to the successful
merchant, and finally brought him
the baronetcy which he had been permitted
to pay for, so that his political and party
services might be rewarded therewith. No
child had blessed their marriage; and as
time drew on, and unlikelihood dissolved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
itself into impossibility, the old lady
yearned the more for the child to mother
and take care of which was denied to her.
As parliamentary duties appropriated an
increasing portion of her husband’s time,
Lady Stableford, after much opposition, at
length obtained Sir James’ consent to her
adoption of a child. Finally she advertised
under an assumed name, stipulating
that the child must be a girl, must be completely
and irrevocably transferred, and
thereafter remain in ignorance of her real
parentage: and she required that the child
must be of gentle birth.</p>

<p>The advertisement was answered by a solicitor
on behalf of a client. Lady Stableford
attempted to insist on a substantiated
disclosure of the parentage, and in consequence
the negotiations terminated with
the refusal of the information and the consequent
withdrawal of Lady Stableford’s
offer of adoption. Within a week Lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
Stableford, returning to the drawing-room
after a solitary dinner, found that during
her absence from the room, a child, plainly
only a few days old, had been left upon the
sofa. The flapping of the blind drew her
attention to the still open French window,
the obvious means by which access to the
room had been obtained. At once summoning
assistance, Lady Stableford had
her park and gardens carefully searched,
but without results. For some time the
child slept, and Lady Stableford was puzzled
what course to adopt. She objected
to an unknown child being thrust upon her
in that way and without her consent; but
the tiny atom of humanity woke with a
plaintive cry, and Lady Stableford’s decision
was made at once. All the motherliness
of her nature welled up, and from that
moment she regarded the child as her own
and treated it precisely as if it had been.</p>

<p>Assuming, rightly or wrongly, she never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
could determine, that this must be the child
concerning which she had been in communication,
she again wrote to the solicitor.
After an interval the letter was returned to
her from the Dead Letter Office, marked
“gone; address unknown.” An appeal to
her own solicitors to help her at once revealed
the fact that there was no solicitor of
the name upon the roll.</p>

<p>Carefully Lady Stableford had examined
the clothing the child had worn and
the shawl in which it had been wrapped.
Everything was new and of good quality,
and every article was scrupulously clean;
but there was no tell-tale coronet upon the
clothing to suggest romance, nothing by
which identity could be traced. Even the
clever brains of her solicitors could suggest
no steps she might take to put an end to her
doubts. Of birth-marks the child had
none.</p>

<p>The identity, as Lady Stableford, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
lady who had advertised the offer of adoption
she knew of course had been disclosed
only to the supposititious solicitor with
whom her own advisers had been in correspondence.
There could be little if any
doubt the child was the same; but that gave
her no further knowledge than the bare
fact, if her supposition were correct, that
the baby girl for whom she had now accepted
the responsibility was born on the
18th of August, 1881. From what her doctor
could tell her there could be no doubt
that if that were not actually the child’s
birthday, her birth must have occurred
within the margin of a day or two on either
side of it.</p>

<p>The child, as she grew up, was not a lovable
child; and long before the fair-haired
baby had reached that stage of lankiness,
when, a few days after they were new, her
frocks always seemed to shrink above her
knees, emphasising the spindle legs which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
needed so little of that emphasis, the girl
was a dark-haired little fury, with a perfectly
ungovernable temper.</p>

<p>Increasing years, and the chronic irritability
of a constant invalid, had all helped
to diminish the patience of Lady Stableford;
and a child of the temper and temperament
of the wayward Evangeline
needs an endless patience in her bringing
up, which patience Lady Stableford had
ceased to possess. The result was that as
time went on the child was left more and
more under the care and control of servants,
none too wisely chosen, and such affection
as Lady Stableford had originally had for
the lonesome little baby had degenerated
into the loveless duty to the child whose
future she had taken into her own hands.</p>

<p>Her schooldays over, Evangeline came
back to her home—a tall, aristocratic-looking
beauty; and, in the hope of companionship,
Lady Stableford turned again to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
girl. But it was then too late. Of duty
the girl knew nothing, and the keen memory
of her youthful mind matched against
any present show of affection which was
made to her, the vivid recollections of the
scoldings and punishments of her nursery
days. The two women were out of sympathy.
The old lady ceased her efforts, the
girl never attempted to make any.</p>

<p>The pair lived together in the same
house. The girl’s life was one constant rebellion
against the irritable, irritated, and
irritating attempts at her own control made
by the elder woman.</p>

<p>Bored to extinction by the life she was
apparently expected to lead, exasperated
by the querulous exactions of the irritable
old lady, driven inexorably by the exuberance
of youth and the nervous restlessness
of her own excitable temperament, Evangeline
had made up her mind that it was a
necessity to her that she should find occupation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
in a working career. The girl was
probably right, but it by no means followed
that her choice had been made in the right
direction. That choice had fallen upon
the stage—had been expressed to Lady Stableford—and
the interview had terminated
with an emphatic refusal of consent and an
emphatic forbidding of further thoughts in
that direction.</p>

<p>Sir James, now long since deceased, had
been a stalwart among Nonconformists.
Lady Stableford, always despising in her
heart the social position of Nonconformity,
had nevertheless lacked the moral courage
to adopt a change of religious persuasion,
and, until increasing years relieved her
from the necessity of the great mental effort
involved in the framing of plausible excuses
for absence, continued, Sunday by
Sunday, to “sit under” the long succession
of electro-plated divines who held forth in
the building which her husband had built,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
endowed, and opened. To say that Lady
Stableford was religious would not be accurate,
because all that a lifetime of Nonconformity
had endowed her with was a restriction
of her mental aspect to the intolerant
narrowness of the bigoted orthodoxy
of her own particular brand. Hatred of
the theatre, which she regarded as a forcing
house of sin, was one of those fixed
ideas she had absorbed and accepted.
Degradation in this world and damnation
in the next she believed to be the foreordained
and inevitably resulting consequence
of any association with things theatrical.</p>

<p>To the inherent inclination of Evangeline
towards a theatrical career was now
added not only the attraction of the forbidden
thing, but also the fascination of that
which has been declared to be wicked. To
this composite and powerful temptation the
girl succumbed. The thing was inevitable—probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
would have happened in
any case; the happening was in all likelihood
no more than precipitated by Lady
Stableford’s attitude and prohibition. But
these affected the relations of the two when
the separation came, and caused the elder
woman many a long month of pain and unhappiness,
of stubborn anger, which step
by step had mellowed into regret, forgiveness,
and then into comprehension and keen
remorse. Drilled by her loneliness the old
lady at last swallowed her pride and
wrote asking the girl to come back to her.</p>

<p>Lady Stableford had waited too long.
There had been occasions, many and oft indeed,
when Evangeline, cowed by the pitiful
hardships in the poverty-stricken existence
of the provincial travelling company
in which she was striving to master
her profession, would have jumped at the
invitation. There had even once or twice
come times when, heartbroken by illness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
by lack of employment, and utter weariness
of spirit, the girl’s pride had been broken,
and she had penned piteous appeals to be
allowed to return home; but the letters had
never been sent, and at last had come success.
The girl’s reviving spirit soaked up
like a sponge the adulation that success
brought in its train, and her parched soul
again expanded into the proud, high-spirited
temperament which had been her inheritance.
But hardship bravely borne had
chastened her, taught her forbearance and
charity of thought and had given her some
control of her hot temper.</p>

<p>The invitation when it reached her was
not refused, but was accepted only for a
visit. A tentative suggestion to settle a
suitable income, and in return that Evangeline
should leave the stage, was gently but
firmly put on one side, and Lady Stableford
perforce had to content herself with
the consent of the girl to make her old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
home her headquarters, living there whenever
her profession did not require her
presence elsewhere, and with the acceptance
of a liberal allowance. Once again the
old lady altered her will, and once more the
name of Evangeline Stableford stood as
chief beneficiary and residuary legatee.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> time to time in the ever-recurring
sequence of murders of which the details
are given to the world by a vigilant and
busy Press, one will be found which stands
out and grips the public attention. Sometimes
it is the gruesome detail of the crime
which awakens the interest of the world at
large. More often it is the mystery which
envelopes its circumstance and stands between
the general curiosity and the satisfaction
thereof by a full explanation of the
motive. But the greatest excitement always
occurs when the victim of the crime
happens to be an individual already, on
other grounds, well known to the public
and more or less a celebrity. Such a murder
occurred a few days before Easter, in
the year 1902. Sir John Rellingham, a well-known
solicitor—one of the most prominent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
men in his profession—stayed on late
at his offices one afternoon, busily engaged
in writing. One by one his junior partners
and managing clerks had drifted away,
and, after the office clock had indicated the
hour of six, Sir John and his confidential
secretary were the only ones who remained
in the building. The solicitor rang his
bell, and his secretary presented himself.</p>

<p>“There’s no need for you to stay any
longer, Smith. Don’t wait for me. I
shall be busy for some time.”</p>

<p>“I’ve just been working on those Trentbeck
leases, and I may as well finish them.
I’m really in no hurry to go, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, those can wait, Smith. I’d rather
you went. Just lock up everything before
you go.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe48_125" id="i_046a">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_046a.jpg" alt="Sir John was found still seated at his writing-table, but dead">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“Sir John was found still seated at his writing-table, but dead”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Very well, Sir John,” had been the answer;
and the man, in obedience to the directions
given him, had put books and papers
away, locked up the safe, and gone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
Of what took place afterwards no one had
any knowledge. On the following day Sir
John was found still seated at his writing-table,
but dead: shot through the temple.</p>

<p>No weapon of any kind was found in the
room, and the appearance of the wound
left no doubt that the shot must have been
fired from only a short distance. That it
was murder there could be no doubt. Suicide
was perfectly impossible.</p>

<p>Before the coroner’s jury had brought in
their verdict of “Wilful murder by some
person or persons unknown,” the whole of
the public Press was seething with excitement.
The firm of Rellingham, Baxter,
Marston &amp; Moorhouse stood at the head of
the profession. It had behind it more than
a century of untarnished and honourable
repute; half the peerage employed the firm
in those parts of their legal necessities
which were of a reputable character, and
the name of one or other of the partners in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
the firm was to be found as a trustee in a
very large proportion of the great family
settlements which were in operation. The
capital for which the firm somehow or
other stood in the relation of trustee ran
into many millions. But the public had
become suspicious of solicitor trustees, and
every one waited for the impending crash
to which the mysterious death of Sir John
appeared to be the usual prelude. Men
whispered, “How much will they break
for?” But the crash never came. An
immediate and searching audit, required at
once by the surviving partners, disclosed
the facts that there was not a penny missing,
not a single suspicious circumstance in
the affairs of the firm. Its repute was as
untarnished, its integrity as unchallengable
as had been the case throughout the long
history of the firm; and the public really
began to believe in the truth of the verdict
at the inquest. The murder, of course, engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
the keenest attention of the police;
but as the weeks flew by without producing
any explanation of the mystery, the partners
of Sir John commenced to take steps
of their own. Sir John, they knew, was a
widower, without children, and with few
relatives, but many friends. Carefully
and methodically his partners, who were
his executors, examined and scrutinised
every paper left by Sir John both at his
house and at his office. Everything was
perfectly open, straightforward, and free
from any trace of suspicion upon which a
clue could be founded. Everything was
ordinary, humdrum, and usual, with one
exception.</p>

<p>This one exception was a clause in Sir
John’s will, and this clause ran as follows:—</p>

<p>“I give and bequeath, free of all charges
and legacy duty, the sum of £20,000 to my
partners, Arthur Baxter, Charles Marston,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
and Edward Moorhouse, upon trust, to be
applied by them to and for the purposes
which I have taken steps to sufficiently indicate
to them, such trust to be executed
according to their honour and integrity, of
which I am well satisfied, and without the
interference, check, or control of any person
or persons whomsoever; and I direct
that if at any time, in the absolute exercise
of their unfettered discretion, they or the
survivors or survivor of them shall at any
time decide that the further existence of
the trust which I have hereby constituted
and created has become impossible, then
and forthwith the said trust shall immediately
cease and determine, and my said
partners or the then survivors or survivor
of them shall stand possessed in their or his
own right and for their or his own use and
benefit of the capital moneys of the said
trust, and shall not be required by anybody
to render accounts or explanations of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
or his dealings with the trust or of their or
his action or actions in regard to it. And
I further direct that if at any time this trust
or the capital moneys of this trust shall be
or shall become the subject matter of litigation
through the interference or intervention
of any party or parties other than my
said partners, or the survivors or survivor
of them, then and forthwith and from the
commencement of such litigation the said
trust shall cease and determine, and the
capital sums of the said trust shall be distributed
and applied in the form and manner
above provided.”</p>

<p>In due course of time the will of Sir
John Rellingham was proved, and, as was
only to be expected, this curious clause was
reprinted in the Press pretty widely. The
mystery of Sir John’s murder had remained
unsolved, and was passing into the oblivion
of public forgetfulness, when curiosity was
again aroused by the strange wording of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
the clause in Sir John’s will. All other
clues had failed. Here was the chance of
a clue. The sensational Press thundered
for a full revelation of this secret trust, arguing
speciously that the mystery of Sir
John’s death was a matter of public concern,
and private interests must bow to
public necessities. The partners met the
demand by a point-blank refusal to disclose
any information whatever. As one of
them—Arthur Baxter—said to an inquisitive
reporter: “The public know of the
clause in the will—the law has compelled
us to disclose it; but if we could have
avoided doing so, we should not have made
even that much public. It would have been
possible, by making other arrangements for
Sir John, to have obviated even that disclosure;
but you can take it from me that
a secret trust in a will is not an uncommon
occurrence. If Sir John had not been
murdered, the clause would never have attracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
any attention. But Sir John was a
clever lawyer, and he knew perfectly well,
when he drew that clause, that public curiosity
as to its meaning need not be satisfied,
and no doubt he preferred to run the risk
of that curiosity rather than constitute the
trust in his own lifetime. So you can tell
your editor, with my compliments and the
compliments of the firm and my partners
individually and collectively, that we will
see him and his paper and all of the rest of
the Press a good deal further on its way to
an undesirable place before we give one
word of explanation of that clause.”</p>

<p>It was an unwise remark to have made.
Mr. Baxter, a steady-going solicitor, in the
security of his knowledge of the law,
scoffed at the possibility of interference.
He had no experience of the inquisitive
prying of a sensational evening paper. The
latter, irritated by the contempt of the solicitor,
laid itself out to teach him a due<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
and proper respect for the power of the
Press. Day after day it returned to the attack,
demanding, in the interests of justice,
a full disclosure. So reiterated became
the demand, so irritating to the public curiosity
was the blank <i>non possumus</i> of the solicitors,
that at last the inevitable happened
and the public came to believe (a perfectly
unwarranted hypothesis) that in the details
of the trust which had been created lay the
explanation of the murder, and the partners
and executors were publicly hounded
into the position of accomplices in the
crime, on the assumption that by keeping
the trust secret they were assisting the culprit
to evade the claims of justice. It is
not difficult for an energetic newspaper to
create such an impression, and the obstinate
silence of the surviving partners of Sir
John fanned the flame of public curiosity.
So rooted did this conviction become that
at last it took hold of Scotland Yard. Once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
a settled conviction obtains a footing in that
quarter, it usually sticks, and the Home Office
took a hand in the game and asked for
an assurance from the firm that the secret
trust had no connection with the murder.</p>

<p>The firm replied that they were unable
to give that or any other assurance.</p>

<p>A lengthy correspondence followed,
which culminated in a personal letter from
the Home Secretary, egged on by Scotland
Yard, asking the partners of the firm to disclose
in confidence the terms and purposes
of the secret trust, and conveying concurrently
an intimation that the disclosure
could be made personally to the Home
Secretary without witnesses, and his personal
assurance that, no matter what the
trust might be, no action against any member
of the firm should be based upon any
such disclosure.</p>

<p>The letter was misunderstood. The
promise of the indemnity was made <i>bona<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
fide</i>. The Home Secretary was perfectly
cognisant that many secret trusts are illegal
or made for illegal objects, and his only
desire was to let the firm know that he personally
would respect that trust and their
confidence, if they would show him that
this particular trust had nothing to do with
the murder.</p>

<p>Knowing the high reputation the firm deservedly
enjoyed, the partners were perfectly
furious at the bare suggestion that
they might be parties to either illegal or
dishonest actions, and the reply to the Home
Secretary was brief and to the point.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—On behalf of myself and the
other surviving partners of this firm, I beg
to state that we resent the tone and contents
and the insinuations of your letter. We
point-blank decline to supply you with any
information whatsoever.—I am, sir, your
obedient servant, (<span class="smcap">Arthur Baxter</span>) for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
Rellingham, Baxter, Marston &amp; Moorhouse.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Home Secretary replied in another
personal letter, regretting that his letter had
been misunderstood, and stating that he felt
assured the letter of Mr. Baxter had been
written in momentary irritation, and that
the firm, upon reconsideration, would see
that the most satisfactory course to pursue
would be a compliance with his suggestion.
The answer to the second letter was still
briefer than had been the former.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—You can go to the devil or wherever
else you feel inclined.—Yours faithfully,
<span class="smcap">Arthur Baxter</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>And the Home Secretary was on the
horns of a dilemma. Afraid to litigate and
thus end the trust—for the terms of the
will were before him—worried by Scotland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
Yard to compel a revelation, which
the determined opposition he was meeting
seemed only to intensify the apparent necessity
of—he nevertheless clearly saw there
was another possibility. Were the partners
in the firm with diabolical cunning
simply doing all they knew to compel him
to litigate, and by so doing convey to them
the actual property in the capital moneys
of the trust, free from any legal or moral
liability? And with the ingrained suspicion
of the Government official he decided
this must be the true explanation.</p>

<p>Finally, on an <i>ex parte</i> motion, he obtained
an injunction pending proceedings,
restraining the trustees from taking any
steps in regard to the dissolution and realisation
of the trust. Having done this he
served notice upon them of his intention to
apply for a rule requiring them to show
cause why the trust should not be disclosed
and the capital moneys paid into court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>And then Mr. Baxter went and consulted
Ashley Tempest.</p>

<p>“It isn’t often you come here on business,
Baxter,” said the barrister, as he rose to
greet his caller.</p>

<p>“No; our work isn’t often in your line.
I think it’s nearly fifty years since we litigated
a criminal case, and we don’t often
litigate on the King’s Bench side either.
To be perfectly frank with you, Tempest,
I’ve come here as much for your advice as
a man of the world as a barrister.”</p>

<p>“There are a good many men better
qualified to give that kind of counsel than
I am.”</p>

<p>“Possibly, but they haven’t your knowledge
of criminal law. Do you know anything
about trusts, Tempest?”</p>

<p>“A bit—I daresay as much as most of
the men on our side of the hedge. But if
it’s a trust, why don’t you go to Overhill?”</p>

<p>“I’m going on to him presently—when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
I’ve heard what you’ve got to say. But
these chancery men always seem to me to be
machines without humanity. To be candid,
my partners and I want to know exactly
where we stand over this infernal secret
trust which old Sir John strapped on
our shoulders. I suppose you’ve heard
about it?”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen what the newspapers have
had to say, and I’ve heard the usual gossip
that’s gone on. What’s the trouble? But
are you wise in coming to me? Suppose it
is—of course I don’t know—suppose it is
mixed up with Sir John’s murder, and
the defence brief were to come along to
me, it might prove very inconvenient to
you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. My partners and I
talked it over, on the supposition that in
such a case you would get the brief, and
I have come to you, at the express wish of
the three of us. You see, we don’t know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
yet what the real objects of this secret trust
are.”</p>

<p>“What on earth do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Just what I say, Tempest. The trust,
as it appears from the clause of the will, is
a holy terror of a mystery; but when you
come to read our instructions you’ll find
that it’s twenty times as much a mystery.
Here, read this!” and the solicitor passed
across a letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To <span class="smcap">Arthur Baxter</span>, <span class="smcap">Charles Marston</span>,
<span class="smcap">Edward Moorhouse</span>, my partners
and friends.</p>

<p>“Forgive me if I remind you that your
partnerships in the firm were not purchased
in cash, but were given to you by myself in
testimony of my high appreciation of your
several abilities, of your worth, your integrity,
and discretion. I have always had
and still retain my high opinion of you all.
As you will be aware, from my will, my remaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
half share in the proprietorship of
the firm I have bequeathed equally amongst
you, and I have in my will also bequeathed
to you jointly the sum of £20,000 upon
trust. May I rest assured you will repay
the obligations I remind you of, by accepting
the trouble this trust may entail? The
object of the trust is to pay the annual income
arising from the capital moneys of
the trust to the partners in the firm for the
time being, as an annual payment for their
services in preserving that capital intact.
Whatever changes may take place in the
firm after my death at any time during the
continuance of the trust, I desire that the
necessary steps shall be taken for its proper
preservation. A certain eventuality may
at some time arise, for which I wish to provide,
should it ever happen. But I cannot
provide for it, save by a disclosure which
would amount to a breach of honour, a
breach of confidence, and a breach of trust.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
That eventuality may never arise. Writing
calmly and deliberately I say, for your
guidance, that it is probable that it never
will arise; but if it ever does, then certain
information is necessary to enable you to act
justly and as I desire. That information
is contained in the sealed packet which
you will find herewith; but, if you have
any gratitude to my memory, then I solemnly
charge you to respect my wishes that
that packet shall remain sealed and its contents
unexamined until events compel this
by the occurrence of the eventuality for
which I am providing. I cannot indicate
what that eventuality will be, or in what
manner it will arise, and I leave the point
entirely to your discretion to determine
whether it has arrived or not. I say only,
that if it does you will at once recognise it.
It will be plainly apparent beyond doubt
that it has arisen, and I warn you that any
eventuality as to which you have doubt cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
be the one I am providing for. If at
the end of a hundred years, from the 18th
August 1881, no such eventuality has
arisen, it will by then be impossible for it
ever to occur, and I then desire that this
packet shall be destroyed unopened. The
commencement of any litigation which
may involve the disclosure of the information
in the packet is to be held to be the termination
of the trust, and I desire this my
wish to be regarded as a vital part of the
trust, and I leave it as a sacred charge
upon you all that the packet shall be immediately
destroyed. Offering you my
gratitude, not only for your past devotion to
the firm, but also for the personal friendship
of yourselves, which it has been my
privilege to enjoy.—I remain, your affectionate
partner, <span class="smcap">John Rellingham</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“You are right about the mystery, Baxter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“Yes. I wonder if any such trust has
ever been created before!”</p>

<p>“I doubt it. Still, it’s all pretty plain
sailing. You three are just to draw the income
till some overpowering circumstance
occurs which advertises itself as the occasion
Sir John refers to.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t told you quite all, Tempest.
The Home Secretary has commenced litigation,
and he has also obtained an <i>ex
parte</i> injunction, restraining our firm from
destroying any documents or dealing with
the trust, pending an order of the
court.”</p>

<p>“Then by the terms of the will the trust
is already at an end, and you rake in and
divide the capital. But it’s rather awkward
about the documents. By the terms
of the trust they must at once be destroyed,
and yet you say the Crown have got an injunction
to prevent you. What have you
done?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“What should you have done, Tempest?”</p>

<p>The barrister laughed. “Are you here
for a professional opinion?”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose you give me that to begin
with?”</p>

<p>“Then I’m bound to tell you you must
obey the order of the court, which overrides
the terms of the trust, and I’m bound
to advise you that disobedience would be
flagrant contempt of court, for which the
penalty is imprisonment until the contempt
is purged. Still, all that’s ancient history
to you and your firm. You didn’t come
here, I’ll warrant, just for me to tell you
that much.”</p>

<p>“No, Tempest, I didn’t.”</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other, and
gradually a smile formed itself on each
face.</p>

<p>“And I’m pretty certain,” said the barrister,
“you did not come here for me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
to tell you what to do. What have you
done?”</p>

<p>“Tempest—frankly, now—tell me what
you think we ought to have done. I’ve
told you our legal difficulty; but there’s the
other one, and that’s why I came to you.
Are these documents likely to be a clue to
the murder? If so, ought we to disclose
them? You are an adept at murders—or
rather at elucidating them. What do you
think?”</p>

<p>“What a situation!”</p>

<p>The barrister rose to his feet and lit a
cigarette as he began to pace his room,
backwards and forwards along the well-marked
path across his carpet. The solicitor
sat and watched him—watched his impassive
face—watched the quick, nervous
fingers as they clicked the rings upon them
backwards and forwards—watched the
cigarette smoked to the end and thrown
away as another was lighted from it. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
last the barrister came to a pause in front
of his fireplace.</p>

<p>“Baxter, the murder has proved an insoluble
mystery, depending upon an unknown
motive. You know everything
about Sir John’s affairs, except what those
papers may disclose. You cannot find a
basis for a motive in what you know. The
odds are the clue is hidden in those papers.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you. I should say that is
probable.”</p>

<p>“But no man contemplates his own murder
without taking steps to avert it, if that
be possible. Sir John took no steps at all.
No man would sit down to be murdered,
and content himself with providing evidence
to catch his murderer afterwards.
Sir John never created the trust for that
purpose. You can rest assured this is not
the eventuality to provide for which that
trust was created. It exists for some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
widely different purpose. And there’s
another thing, Baxter. Sir John says a
disclosure would be a breach of faith.
That would involve a third person. It is
that third person on whose behalf Sir John
has gone to all that trouble. It wasn’t
himself he was bothering about. So long
as he was alive he could have dealt with
the thing himself, or he might have been
waiting for the knowledge that it never
would arise. That was why he did not
constitute the trust during his own lifetime,
but preferred rather to run the risk of
public curiosity about the clause in his
will.”</p>

<p>“What should you have done, Tempest?”</p>

<p>“I should have destroyed the papers, I
think; but there is one awful risk. Suppose
they do contain the clue to the murder,
and through the lack of that clue an
innocent person gets hanged?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“Well, as a matter of fact we burnt them
yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Then you elected to run that risk?”</p>

<p>“Tempest, it isn’t fair to a lawyer to tell
him only half the tale. Wrapped round
the papers was another slip. As nearly as
I remember, the words written on it were
as follows:—</p>

<p>“‘This paper is to be burnt the moment
it has been read. I desire that no memorandum
of it shall ever be put into writing.
If litigation is threatened, this
packet is to be burned immediately. A
duplicate set of the papers is deposited in
the name of the firm at the Chancery Lane
Safe Deposit. The existence of this duplicate
set is not to be disclosed. I leave it
to the honour and integrity of my partners
that if under litigation the trust ceases to
exist, it shall at the earliest safe opportunity
be again reconstituted.’”</p>

<p>“That does away with the risk I spoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
of. You were certainly right to destroy
the papers.”</p>

<p>“In spite of the court?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so. I’m sure of it. The
old boy intended you to stand the racket.
I should fancy he anticipated it, though
it’s more likely he expected litigation from
the heir-at-law than the Crown.”</p>

<p>“That is the conclusion my partners and
I came to. But, Tempest, ought we to disclose
the other simply to catch the murderer?”</p>

<p>“No, I think not. Sir John is dead.
You can’t bring him to life again. All
you can do is to regard his wishes. I bet
he’d prefer that to the stringing up of some
poor devil.”</p>

<p>When the motion came on in court the
trust was upheld. As constituted under
the will it had been perfectly valid; but
now under the terms of the will the litigation
had put an end to it, and the court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
ruled that the capital moneys had now
vested in the surviving partners for their
own benefit.</p>

<p>“Come and dine with all of us to-night,
Tempest,” said one of the partners, as they
left the law courts after hearing judgment
given. “We’re in a deuce of a quandary!”</p>

<p>The invitation was accepted, and after
dinner the four men sat over the walnuts
and the wine in the sumptuously furnished
bachelor chambers of Arthur Baxter.</p>

<p>“You see, Tempest,” said the host, “the
secret trust is already reconstituted. We
did it this afternoon. We can’t afford to
run the risk of one of us dying and his executors
claiming any proprietorship in the
money. So the position now is exactly as
it was when the will was first proved. But
now that the court has declared the money
to belong to us personally, the state of affairs
isn’t particularly pleasant, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
that infernal evening rag is bound to adopt
the standpoint that by preventing the elucidation
of the murder we have advantaged
our own pockets, and that we took the line
we did for that reason.”</p>

<p>“Is that as far as you’ve got, Baxter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“My dear man, don’t you see what the
logical consequence is? Don’t any of you
see it?”</p>

<p>The three solicitors looked at each other
in surprise, and then glanced back at Tempest,
as his grave face filled with concern,
and they looked the question to him which
they waited for the barrister to answer.</p>

<p>“Moorhouse, I saw you at Epsom, so I
suppose you bet? Well, I’ll lay you a
pound to a penny that unless the real murderer
of Sir John is discovered pretty
quickly, one or other of you three, if not all
of you, will be accused of the murder—very
likely arrested for it, if they can find the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
semblance of any circumstantial evidence.
If you’ll take my advice, you’ll look pretty
carefully to your alibis on the evening and
night Sir John was murdered.”</p>

<p>“You cannot mean that seriously, Tempest?”</p>

<p>“I do mean it, and I’m perfectly serious.
You three men are not in an enviable position.”</p>

<p>As Tempest spoke he looked across the
table to where Marston was sitting. His
face had gone as white as a sheet, and his
fingers were trembling as mechanically he
eased the collar at his throat.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Marston?” said one
of his partners.</p>

<p>“It’s three months ago. I’ve no more
idea than the man in the moon what I was
doing that evening.”</p>

<p>“Keep an engagement book?” asked
Tempest.</p>

<p>“No—not private things. Just stick the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
cards up on the mantelpiece till the shows
are over and then pitch ’em away.”</p>

<p>“Nor a diary?”</p>

<p>“No. Never did such a thing.”</p>

<p>“Would your wife know?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t got a wife.”</p>

<p>“Do you think your servants would be
likely to?”</p>

<p>“No. What can I do, Tempest?”</p>

<p>“Well, praying seems to be about all
that’s left.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think we are any of us
likely to be accused?”</p>

<p>“Simply because you must have motive
for a murder. No one knows or can suggest
the shadow of a motive in regard to
Sir John. You three who knew him intimately
and all his private affairs know of
nothing that even hints at a motive. You
have gone through all his papers since his
death, and you can find nothing there to
give you a clue. Nobody, as far as you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
know, stood to profit by Sir John’s death
except——”</p>

<p>“Except whom?”</p>

<p>“Except yourselves. Now, remember
the police know less than you do, so they
can guess at no motive, save the obvious
one I have pointed out to you—that halfpenny
rag has hounded Scotland Yard on
till they got the Home Office to interfere
about the trust. They will go on now—mark
my words—on the basis that the line
you three took was dictated by your desire
to bring the trust to an end. They will
point out how you all stood to benefit by
Sir John’s death. They will assume—no
matter how much you may deny it—that
being his partners you three were aware
beforehand both of the terms of the will
and of the trust. Don’t forget what the
terms of the will were—‘to be applied by
them to and for the purposes which I have
taken steps to sufficiently indicate to them’—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
don’t forget he divides his share of
the partnership with you. Just think what
the obvious meaning of that is—what nine
men out of ten would assume to be the
meaning——”</p>

<p>“What do you say that is, Tempest?”</p>

<p>“Simply that he had already told you.
Nobody would, by the wildest guess, be
likely to imagine the existence of such a
letter as he left. And even the letter you
can’t in honour disclose till it becomes a
matter of life and death.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem to be very far off being
that even now.”</p>

<p>“There’s another thing you fellows have
overlooked. That shot was obviously
fired inside the room. There was nobody
in the offices when Smith left, except Sir
John. How many keys are there?”</p>

<p>“We’ve each got one. Smith has one
and the cleaner has one. The clerks come
whilst she is there. She does their rooms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
first and then does ours afterwards. They
arrive before she has finished.”</p>

<p>“Had Sir John a key?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We found it on his bunch in his
pocket after he was dead.”</p>

<p>“Then his key wasn’t used. Now,
Smith locked the door when he left. It’s
a spring latch—that came out at the inquest.
So did Smith’s alibi that evening.
So did the old woman’s. That only leaves
the three keys you chaps have. There’s no
difficulty about getting out afterwards—it’s
the getting in that matters.”</p>

<p>“God! Tempest, you are building up
a case against us.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s only one loophole; and
that’s the possibility that Sir John himself
opened the door to his murderer. I really
think that’s the true explanation, because
he had previously told Smith he wished
him to go. I’m pretty certain myself that
Sir John was expecting somebody whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
he wished to see without the visit being
known. But the police will try the other
tack first, and they will try and fix the responsibility
on one or all of you three.
Don’t let me frighten you too soon. They
couldn’t get a conviction on what we or
they know at present; but once, by accident
or by research, they can get any fact that
seems to corroborate the theory, then the
position is changed. You can rest assured
they are looking for such a fact already.
That’s what I meant in warning you about
your alibis.”</p>

<p>“Well, mine’s good enough,” said Baxter.
“I was at the club.”</p>

<p>“What time did you go there?”</p>

<p>“About eight, and I stayed playing
cards till nearly midnight.”</p>

<p>“Baxter, don’t forget Smith left Sir
John soon after six. His dead body wasn’t
found till next morning. You’ve got to
account for the time from six to eight and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
after midnight. Then Marston has absolutely
forgotten. How about you, Moorhouse?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was at the theatre.”</p>

<p>“That’s only another partial one, then.
Why on earth don’t you people try to find
out who did murder the man and not wait
till you are in sight of the rope yourselves
before you start?”</p>

<p>“But what can we do?”</p>

<p>“You can offer a reward for one thing.
You can engage Dennis Yardley, the detective,
for another.”</p>

<p>“Tempest, can we make it worth your
while for you to take a hand in it?”</p>

<p>“No. I’m not keen at playing detective
professionally. It’s not my profession.
But I don’t mind helping Yardley, as I’ve
done in other cases, if that’s what you
want.”</p>

<p>“Will you take a retainer from us?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“In case any of us are accused.”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly. Fix it up with my
clerk in the morning. Book it as <i>in re</i>
Rellingham. Now, don’t do anything to
draw suspicion upon yourselves, but do
your utmost to account for how you all
spent that particular night. Of course, I
may be quite wrong in what I’ve said. I
hope I am, but I can’t help seeing the risk.”</p>

<p>The four men separated, each going his
lonely way home. But justification of all
Tempest had said was to follow quickly.
Step by step, on the very lines the barrister
had indicated, the case was argued the following
day in a leader in the same paper
that had previously taken up the matter,
and the article wound up with a definite
demand for the arrest and trial of the three
surviving partners in the firm.</p>

<p>That a conviction could be obtained was
a proposition which few cared to admit;
but, on the other hand, the bulk of the public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
were quite willing to commit themselves
to the ready admission that “there
might be something in it after all.” And,
day by day, as the suspicion grew, the position
of the three solicitors became almost
unbearable. They felt themselves slowly
but only too certainly drifting into the position
of social lepers. And there was
nothing more that they could do. They
thought of libel, and the thing went to
Lake Rodgers, K. C., for an opinion. His
opinion was that the article had been so
carefully written that it contained no libel,
and the opinion ended with the friendly
hint that a failure to obtain a verdict would
probably be more damaging under the circumstances
than inaction.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> summer of 1902 slowly slipped
away. Twenty years had now passed since
Ashley Tempest had hung up the miniature
of the dead Dolores in his chambers—to
him twenty busy and eventful years.
He was by now one of the leading members
of his profession—the busiest junior at the
bar. The courts had risen for the vacation
which Tempest was to spend with the Shifnals.
Securing his seat in the train at
Euston, he had bought the evening papers
and pitched them in a heap in the corner
he had appropriated, and after doing so
was standing in the fresh air until the last
moment, smoking one of his perpetual
cigarettes.</p>

<p>As the doors were being noisily slammed
along the train, he jumped in and soon was
smoothly gliding towards his destination.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
He heaved a sigh of relief, for with the
start from London he felt his holiday had
begun, and he could put the worries of his
work behind him. Opening a copy of the
<i>Globe</i> his attention was caught by the
leaded capitals announcing a “Sensational
Tragedy.” The report that followed was
not very lengthy:</p>

<p>“A gruesome discovery has been made
this afternoon at the Charing Cross Hotel.
A chambermaid, on entering one of the
bedrooms in the annexe which had not
been let and which was supposed to be unoccupied,
was horror-struck to find lying
upon the bed the dead and nude body of a
young woman. On the table by the bedside
was an opened half-bottle of champagne
and a glass, evidently that from which the
wine had been drunk. We are informed
that the victim of this tragedy, the facts of
which plainly point to suicide, was of surpassing
beauty, but is unknown in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
hotel. No one can identify the body, and
all the staff of the hotel emphatically declare
the lady was not registered there as
a visitor. Life had only been extinct for a
short time, as the body, when found, was
still warm.”</p>

<p>Tempest read the account with amazement,
for in every detail it reproduced the
story which was so deeply engraved on his
memory. Here was what he had been
waiting for for twenty years—a case of suicide,
with a nude body. Save in cases of
drowning, that one detail had differentiated
the case of Dolores Alvarez from all
others he had ever heard of, and it had always
puzzled him. He had waited and
waited for a similar case, hoping that by
some chance the motive or some other circumstance
might give him the clue to an
answer to the perpetual Why? which was
ever in his mind as often as his eyes turned
to the miniature over his mantelpiece. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
had waited in vain, until here at last was
what he had looked for, and that a more
exact reproduction of the former story than
his wildest dreams had ever led him to imagine
could possibly occur. He put the
paper down, and as the train ran into Willesden
his mind was made up. Calling a
porter to look after his luggage he wired
to Lady Shifnal, postponing his visit, and
returned to town by the underground.
Leaving the train at Westminster Station
he walked into Scotland Yard and asked
for Inspector Parkyns.</p>

<p>“Parkyns,” he said, “I want you to do
me a favour.”</p>

<p>“Delighted to, if I can, Mr. Tempest.”</p>

<p>“You’ve seen the account of this suicide
at the Charing Cross Hotel?”</p>

<p>“Yes. As it happens, the case is in my
hands.”</p>

<p>“That’s lucky. I want you to take me
and let me see the room and the body without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
making any fuss about it. Can you do
it?”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps it can be managed.
Why are you so keen about it, sir? You
are not briefed by anybody yet, are you,
sir?”</p>

<p>“No, Parkyns. Honest injun—I’m not.
It’s purely curiosity. Look here, inspector!
Do you remember the suicide of the actress
Dolores Alvarez—the sister of Lady Madeley,
you know—about twenty years ago?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do. I was in that as well;
but I’d really forgotten all about it.”</p>

<p>“I was in that case too, Parkyns. I had
a watching brief at the inquest from Lord
Madeley’s solicitor, and ever since then
that case has stuck in my mind, because I
never could see why she committed suicide,
and I want to know why. I don’t know
whether you have noticed, now; but in this
case to-day, saving locale, you get every
single detail of that other case duplicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
in this one. Of course, coincidences do occur
in the world. I don’t suppose or suggest
there is any connection between the
two; but the details are so alike, that if this
one can be explained it may give me a hint
I can build on, and so find an explanation
of the other.”</p>

<p>“I see what you mean, sir. Can you
come along now, at once?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if that will suit you: any time you
like.”</p>

<p>“We’d better go at once, as they will be
removing the body to the mortuary in an
hour or two.”</p>

<p>Together the two men walked to the
Charing Cross Hotel, and Parkyns led
the way to the bedroom, outside of which
a constable was stationed.</p>

<p>“Has anyone been in since I left?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. The door hasn’t been opened,”
answered the policeman.</p>

<p>“Well, then, Mr. Tempest, you’ll find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
everything exactly as I left it, and I left it
exactly as I found it, except that we got a
sheet to cover the body with. The hotel
people say nothing was touched after the
body was found before I got here, and they
sent for me at once. Just as I arrived, the
doctor came, and he just made certain that
life was extinct, and told me to send the
glass and the bottle to the analyst, and get
the body removed to the mortuary, and I
went away to make arrangements. The
people here are positive she was not staying
as a guest in the hotel, and none of
them recognise the lady. Now, Mr. Tempest,
you know as much as I do. Would
you like to look at the body, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I want to.”</p>

<p>The inspector turned down the sheet,
and Tempest stared in astonishment. Line
for line, feature for feature, the face was
that of Dolores Alvarez, as he remembered
seeing her. The little smile upon the lips,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
the long dark eyelashes resting upon the
cheek, the profusion of long black hair lying
loose upon the pillow, the same delicately
aristocratic features were here
again, exactly reproduced. Were it not
that for twenty years the one woman had
been dead, and lying buried in her grave,
Tempest would have sworn it was the same
body he had seen once before, under circumstances
so similar. The likeness and
identity were uncanny, and the barrister
knew it was no freak of his imagination,
for was not the face of Dolores hanging
over his mantelshelf, where he had looked
at it that morning?</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, sir?”</p>

<p>“Parkyns, you say you were in the Alvarez
case?”</p>

<p>“I was, sir; but, as I told you, I’d forgotten
it.”</p>

<p>“And you haven’t noticed the likeness?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_090a">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_090a.jpg" alt="Line for line, feature for feature, the face was that of Dolores Alvarez">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“Line for line, feature for feature, the face was that of Dolores Alvarez”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“I never saw the body of Miss Alvarez.”</p>

<p>“Well, I did see her, and I remember her
face. I’ve got a miniature of her hanging
in my chambers, so I know it well. Now,
you can take it from me, inspector, that the
two faces are so similar that they might be
the same woman. If we didn’t know the
one was dead, and had been buried twenty
years ago, I would have taken my oath they
were the same. The likeness is as strong
as that. I never saw such a likeness in my
life. Talk about doubles, it’s an absolute
reincarnation.”</p>

<p>The inspector was silent as Tempest,
leaning on the foot of the bed, gazed fascinated
at the face of the dead woman.</p>

<p>“How are you going to identify her?
You’ll have to try.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to have the body photographed
here, before it is moved, and then
we shall take a cast of the face, and thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
examine the body. That’s all that
we can do, as far as I can see. We shall
examine the teeth, and I think we shall try
and get finger-prints; but she hardly looks
as if her finger-prints are likely to be in our
collection.”</p>

<p>“No. There’s nothing of the criminal
in that face. Was she married?”</p>

<p>“The doctor says not, and there is no
mark of any wedding-ring.”</p>

<p>“What colour are her eyes?”</p>

<p>“Very dark blue.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s funny again! So were the
eyes of Miss Alvarez, and she was a Spaniard.
When’s the inquest?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow, at eleven.”</p>

<p>“I shall be there. What’s the poison?”</p>

<p>“Prussic acid, so the doctor says. He
said he could plainly smell it in her mouth
when he came.”</p>

<p>Tempest moved to the side of the bed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
and leant over the face. The faint odour
of almonds was still perceptible.</p>

<p>“Yes, I can smell it myself. There
won’t be much mystery about the manner
of death.”</p>

<p>Tempest stayed until the body was removed,
and wondered at the reverence
with which it was handled by men who
must have long been accustomed to death
and callous at its manifestations, and then,
saying good night to Parkyns, he left. As
he did so he turned back. “I say, Parkyns,
tell Yardley about it, and send word
I’d particularly like him to come to the inquest,
if he can manage it, as I think it will
be an interesting case. There’s more here
than there looks at first sight.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that, sir?”</p>

<p>“Ah, I’d like to think things over a bit.”</p>

<p>“Shall you give evidence or anything to-morrow,
Mr. Tempest?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord, no! You needn’t be afraid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
of me getting a rise out of any of your people.
I’m not going to do that. To be
perfectly frank, Parkyns, I don’t approve
altogether of coroner’s inquests. They
serve a useful purpose in deciding whether
a death is a natural one or not. But I
think they ought to stop there. They must
hamper your people fearfully, if it is a case
that has to come to you. I myself don’t
believe in making things public till you
can go straight and arrest your man. The
coroner’s inquests only too often warn him
to keep away.”</p>

<p>“I quite agree with you, sir. But still
it’s the law, and we have to put up with
it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. But as it is the law, get
’em over, and a verdict given as quickly as
possible, to leave your crowd with free
hands. That’s what I think.”</p>

<p>The inquest took place in due course the
following day. The proceedings were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
brief and formal. The body had been
identified in the meantime as that of Miss
Evangeline Stableford, a well-known provincial
actress; and after evidence of identity
and of the finding of the body, the
medical evidence which followed left no
room for any doubt as to the cause of death.
The verdict of the jury was unanimous
and immediate: “Suicide by poisoning
with prussic acid during temporary insanity,”
in spite of the remarks in the summing
up of the coroner, that they had no evidence
before them of the state of mind of the
deceased. But then a coroner’s jury so
often takes the bit in their teeth. The girl
was too beautiful to be buried with a stake
driven through her body, which many
people still believe is even yet the legal
consequence of a bare verdict of suicide.</p>

<p>The public and the jury drifted out of
the room; and the coroner, as he left, noticing
the barrister, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“Were you briefed here to-day, Mr.
Tempest?”</p>

<p>“No—just curiosity; like the ’busman
who takes his holiday by riding on another
man’s ’bus.”</p>

<p>“Well, from what one hears, I should
have thought you were too busy to bother
about us.”</p>

<p>The barrister laughed. “The courts
aren’t sitting.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. I’d forgotten. Inquests,
you know, aren’t postponed over
vacations. Good morning.”</p>

<p>Tempest joined Yardley and Parkyns on
the pavement outside.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Tempest, what do you think
of it all?” said the inspector.</p>

<p>“Parkyns, you’ve known me a good
many years now. It must be nearly twenty
years since I first cross-examined you at
the Old Bailey.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it must be quite that long.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“And we’ve been interested together or
against each other in the same cases a good
many times since then, haven’t we?”</p>

<p>“We have, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, have you ever known me to make
a positive statement without being fairly
certain of it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t call one to mind.”</p>

<p>“And when I do make a positive statement,
I’m not often wrong. Now am I,
inspector?”</p>

<p>“I’ve never known you wrong yet, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t say as much as that, Parkyns;
but I’m going to make a definite
assertion now, and I think you can depend
upon it.”</p>

<p>The two detectives listened with rapt
attention as the barrister continued.</p>

<p>“That woman no more committed suicide
than I’ve done. It isn’t suicide at all.
She was murdered.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think so?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“Just think, Parkyns. The body is found
nude.”</p>

<p>“Quite so, sir; but so was Miss Alvarez,
and you’ve never said that case wasn’t
suicide——”</p>

<p>“I agree, Parkyns, I never have said so;
but when the body of Miss Alvarez was
found in the bedroom of her flat, her
clothes were there in the room. Now, it’s
never dawned on you, or on the coroner or
on the jury, that Miss Stableford’s clothes
were not in the bedroom or in the hotel.
There was nothing whatever in the room
in the way of personal belongings; there
was not even a hairpin, and yet her hair
was undone and loose on the pillow. Now,
a decent respectable woman, as we know
Miss Stableford was, doesn’t walk about
the corridors of a decent respectable hotel
as this is, in broad daylight, with even her
hair undone. And she certainly doesn’t
walk about the corridors without her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
clothes on. I think that’s sound argument.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Yardley, “do you think
she was murdered somewhere else and
taken there afterwards?”</p>

<p>“No, not in the least. You can’t carry
a dead body into a hotel without it being
noticed, nor dare anyone risk carrying a
nude dead body along the corridor from
one room to another. No, the girl was
murdered in the room where her body was
found, and only an hour or two before she
was found, and her clothes, belongings and
hairpins were taken away afterwards.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Yardley.</p>

<p>“Ah! now we get to speculation; but I
think it was an attempt to hide her identity.
There you have your clue, Parkyns. At
any rate, it’s the only clue I see at the
moment, and it’s one well worth your
while to follow up.”</p>

<p>“But in what way is it a clue?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“It’s a clue, because whoever committed
that murder—and mind you it was murder,
I’ve not a shadow of a doubt about
that—whoever committed that murder
took pains that the body should not be
identified. Therefore, they feared that
identification might throw suspicion in
their direction. You must first make certain
that the body is that of Miss Stableford.
You say there were two teeth
stopped with gold in the upper jaw. Advertise
for her dentist, and see if you can
identify that stopping. If you do that,
then trace back the history of Miss Stableford
till you find someone likely to have
desired her death; someone upon whom
the mere proof of identity can throw suspicion.”</p>

<p>The barrister nodded to the two detectives
and went his way.</p>

<p>They watched him disappear in the
crowd, and as they parted Parkyns said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>“Jove! I wish we’d got him in the
force.”</p>

<p>“Yes. He’d be a jewel for you, wouldn’t
he? I often wonder how it is he always
puts his finger on the spot, and generally a
spot nobody else ever thought of.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s funny. I’ve no doubt whatever
he is right, and that it’s a case of
murder. Why didn’t you and I think of
that? Honour bright, I’d have cheerfully
taken the jury’s verdict if it hadn’t been
for what he said.”</p>

<p>“So should I,” answered Yardley.
“Parkyns,” he continued, “if the girl were
murdered, somebody did it. Who was it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s just the little detail you and
I have got to try to find out.”</p>

<p>Tempest left town to pay his postponed
visit. With the verdict of suicide the public
rested content; and after the natural
publicity of the funeral, the public interest
in the case quickly died down. This was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
what Yardley and Parkyns desired, and
quietly and unostentatiously they then began
to prosecute their inquiries. The stage
history of Miss Stableford was general
knowledge in the profession, and it was a
simple matter to get into touch with Lady
Stableford and learn all she knew of the
girl’s life. She could tell them, too, of the
stopped teeth, and with that all doubt as
to the identification ended. Putting the
accounts together it was evident that they
had the complete story, and that with an
accuracy of full detail amply sufficient to
demonstrate that ostensibly there was
nothing in the life of Evangeline Stableford
which they could legitimately regard
as a starting point for an investigation with
any hope of this resulting in an explanation
of the mystery. The thing was an absolute
blank. Their inquiries showed beyond
doubt that Miss Stableford was a young provincial
actress of some talent and of great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
promise, leading an exemplary life, and
possessed of such means that inducement to
the contrary on that score was in her case
wholly lacking. Lady Stableford, bitterly
distressed at the fate which had overtaken
one who to all intents and purposes was her
own daughter, had placed ample funds at
Yardley’s disposal, in the hope of finding a
clue to the mystery, and Yardley and Parkyns
prosecuted their research with zeal
and vigor. But all to no purpose.</p>

<p>With the end of the vacation, Tempest
returned to town, and Yardley lost no time
in making him aware of the result of their
investigations.</p>

<p>Tempest, sitting in his chambers, listened
attentively to what the other men told him,
and frankly confessed that he was absolutely
puzzled. But in his own mind he
felt that the explanation lay in the mystery
surrounding the girl’s birth and in the great
likeness which existed between Evangeline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
Stableford and Dolores Alvarez. He went
to Somerset House, and, knowing the date
of the birth of Miss Stableford, he hunted
for the certificate. No child named Alvarez
had been born in that year. That
did not surprise him. He even went to the
trouble of getting copies of every certificate
of the births of an illegitimate child
within a month on either side of the day on
which a child apparently evidently less than
ten days old had been found by Lady
Stableford on the couch in her drawing-room.
Tempest knew that from the child’s
clothes it was evident that the mother must
have been financially in comfortable circumstances
at the time, and so was able
to eliminate the bulk of the children of
whose births he had certificates, by reason
of the places of birth. The remainder
Yardley investigated one by one. It was
a long and unpleasant task, but in the end
it had been possible in every case to trace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
each child—for a period sufficiently prolonged
to establish it as quite impossible
that Miss Stableford could be one of these
children. But the likeness between the
two women haunted Tempest, and he
wondered whether the real explanation
was that Evangeline Stableford was the
child of Dolores Alvarez. But an interview
with the surgeon who had made the
post-mortem examination, and a reference
by the latter to his case book, left no doubt
of the fact that Miss Alvarez had never
had a child. Utterly puzzled, Tempest
turned to the only remaining possibility
that Miss Stableford might be the daughter
of Lady Madeley; but a few careful inquiries
showed that Lord and Lady Madeley
had been married some days before
Lady Stableford had found the child. By
the fashionable intelligence in different
papers, and by the succession of hotel registers,
Tempest was able to trace the movements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
of the married pair as day by day
in easy stages they journeyed overland to
Southern Italy. The last supposition,
therefore, was an absolute impossibility,
and Tempest finally could see no other
conclusion than that the amazing likeness
was after all only coincidence.</p>

<p>So that they had nothing to go upon save
the details of the tragedy. These were
strangely destitute of any enlightening clue.</p>

<p>Late one evening, Yardley and Parkyns
called at Tempest’s chambers in order to
keep an appointment for which Parkyns
had asked.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” asked the barrister.</p>

<p>“Mr. Tempest, I’m at my wits’ end
about the murder of Miss Stableford. I’ve
done everything I can think of, so has Yardley.
We haven’t found out a thing, and
the mystery is at the precise point it was
when we started. I’ve come to say that
unless you can suggest anything, I’m afraid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
I must give it up. You see, sir, this isn’t
the only thing I have to attend to. Have
you thought of anything, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Parkyns, many things, and I’ve
done a little bit of inquiry myself; but I
must say all to no purpose, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to give it up, if you think
there is anything more to be done. Are
you going to give it up, sir? Because if
you do, there isn’t much use of our going
on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t quite fair to me to say that,
inspector. I’m only an amateur. My interest
in it isn’t professional.”</p>

<p>“What is your interest then, Mr. Tempest?”</p>

<p>The barrister turned and took from its
nail above the mantelpiece, in front of
which he was standing, a miniature, which
he passed to the detective.</p>

<p>“That’s the explanation of my interest,
inspector.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“Where did you get this from, sir? Did
Lady Stableford give it to you?”</p>

<p>“No. Who do you think it is?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a portrait of Miss Stableford,
isn’t it.”</p>

<p>“No, not at all. It’s a portrait of Miss
Alvarez. It’s been hanging on that nail
for twenty years. It’s the miniature I told
you of. Your mistake proves how great
the likeness is. Now, do you understand
how my curiosity has been provoked?”</p>

<p>“I think I do, sir.”</p>

<p>“So far so good. Now, I’ve not given
it up yet. There are two little details that
might pay for investigation. It’s no good
trying to trace the prussic acid, but you’ve
got the champagne bottle. You might try
and trace that, and find out where that was
bought and by whom. It’s labelled Veuve
Cliquot ’93, but I remember the cork.
You’ve got it still, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“Last night I ordered a bottle of Cliquot
’93 at the club, and I saw the cork of that.
It’s got a totally different brand on it.
Here it is.” And the barrister passed the
cork to the two detectives.</p>

<p>“But what do you make of that, sir?”</p>

<p>“Simply this—that one bottle or other
is spurious. It’s not very likely the club
one is wrong, but still find out which is
spurious; and if it’s the one found in the
hotel—you know the hotel people say they
didn’t sell that bottle—then you must hunt
round and find out where the spurious stuff
is being made and sold. Then there’s another
thing. The bedrooms at the hotel
all have self-closing doors, locking with
spring latches. They need the right key
to open the doors.”</p>

<p>“Quite so.”</p>

<p>“Well, from the inquiries you made at
the time it was perfectly evident that no
one had had the key of that bedroom, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
the key had not left the office for more than
a week. The body had not been dead
more than a few hours even when I saw it.
The scent of prussic acid will disappear
under twenty-four hours. Now, somebody
entered that bedroom with a key. There
are two master keys to find. One will open
all doors on that corridor. That is in the
possession of the head chambermaid, who
has charge of that corridor. The other,
which will open all doors in the annexe, the
manager has. It is locked in his safe, and
it is quite impossible that that one can have
been used.”</p>

<p>“Then that proves the chambermaid’s
key was used?”</p>

<p>“It looks like it; but in that case the
chambermaid herself used it, for if you
remember in her evidence at the inquest
she said the key which she wore on the
chain attached to her belt had never
been out of her possession all day. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
volunteered that evidence which is so
damning that she would never have said it
except on the assumption of its entire truth
and her absolute innocence when she easily
might have overlooked the conclusion it
pointed to. So I don’t think the chambermaid’s
key was used.”</p>

<p>“Then there must be another key?”</p>

<p>“Wait a bit, Yardley. Suppose that
murder was premeditated? The murderer
would not have done it without making
arrangements, and thinking out his plans
and seeing that they were possible. You
can’t walk blindly into an hotel and make
certain that things will fall out so absolutely
as you require them to, that you can
let your safety and escape after committing
a murder depend upon such a coincidence.
The thing isn’t reasonable. The chambermaid
thinks that murder must have been
committed between two and three in the
afternoon, because that is the only time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
during the day when there is no one
actually on duty in the corridor. In the
morning they are attending to the rooms,
and they have to stay about till two o’clock
to answer the bells of those people who
come to their rooms to wash or change for
lunch. About three o’clock people come
to their rooms to dress to go out calling,
then others change for tea, and again others
change for dinner, and from two to three
is the only slack time during the day.”</p>

<p>“How do you know all this, Mr. Tempest?”
put in the inspector.</p>

<p>The barrister laughed. “I had a long
and interesting interview with that chambermaid
two days ago.”</p>

<p>“Then where was she during that time—from
two to three on the day of the
murder?”</p>

<p>“Yardley, I’ll make a real detective of
you some day; you’re getting quite promising
in the way you reason out things.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
Well, I’ll tell you. She was having her
<i>dinner</i>, and had got the key with her. Now
she says it is a regular thing that all the
maids are at their dinner between two and
three. The murderer probably knew that,
and if so there you get premeditation again.
The most likely way for that to be known
would be for the murderer to have himself
stayed in the hotel and found it out.”</p>

<p>“But how could he get the key?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’ve been wondering, Yardley,
and I can suggest one way. Suppose
the man goes and stays in the hotel in that
very room, and whilst the room is in his
occupation, and the key legitimately in his
possession, suppose he had a duplicate
made of it? Then he can keep and use
that duplicate when he likes.”</p>

<p>“But suppose all you say be true, Tempest.
The girl was not staying in the hotel.
How in the name of fortune could he lure
a respectable girl up to his bedroom?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“My dear Yardley, how was the girl to
know it was his bedroom? There are
always suites of rooms in a hotel. Take it,
for example, that the man was an impresario,
or said he was, and, deluding her into
the idea that he wished to talk business, invited
her to go to his sitting-room. The
girl would go fast enough.”</p>

<p>“Would she stay when she got there and
found it was a bedroom?”</p>

<p>“H’m—never thought of that. You’ve
caught me out there, Yardley. But—but—wait—wait
a moment;” and the barrister
picked up another cigarette and lighted it,
and the two men watched him as he began
unconsciously to pace up and down the
room. Yardley knew the trick and waited
in silence.</p>

<p>“Yardley, you’ve brought it one step
nearer. It must have been a woman who
murdered the girl. Any story would be
sufficient excuse for her going to a woman’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
bedroom, and for her staying there after
she got into the room. Now there is another
point, Yardley. All the keys have
stamped on them the name of the hotel and
the number. No shop would deliberately
duplicate such a key. They would know
it could not be wanted for any legitimate
purpose. A model must have been taken in
wax and the key made from that. I wish
I had thought of that before. Still, it may
not be too late. The room had been empty
for a week before the body was found
there. The chambermaid told me nobody
had been put in it since. Yardley, go to
the Charing Cross Hotel at once, ask to
see that key, and examine it carefully, and
see if there is any sign of wax on it. If
there is you will know I am right, and it
will prove something else besides.”</p>

<p>“What else will it prove?”</p>

<p>“Just this, that the previous occupant of
the room is the guilty person, for if anyone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
has used the key in between there will
be no wax on it. At least the odds are a
hundred to one.”</p>

<p>The two detectives took their leave and
went straight to the hotel. It was exactly
as Tempest had anticipated. There were
still traces of wax in the wards of the keys.
It was a simple matter to ascertain that the
last occupant of the room had been a lady
who had given her name as Mrs. Garnett.
A little investigation elicited the fact that
she had complained of her room being
very dark, and had, by her own request,
been moved into one on the opposite side
of the passage. She had remained in the
hotel until after the dead body had been
discovered, and had left, declaring vehemently
that she would never be able to sleep
after her experience. The clerk and the
other hotel servants had no very definite
recollection of the lady, save that she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
always dressed in black, and was dark and
middle-aged.</p>

<p>As her own room was only just across
the passage she could, of course, easily
make certain the other room was not occupied.
A stranger to the hotel wouldn’t
know that.</p>

<p>“Yes, it all seems very simple now,
doesn’t it, Parkyns?”</p>

<p>“Yardley, it makes us look rather amateurs.
There’s nothing in it all that we
couldn’t have found out. Here you and I
have been working on it for weeks, and we
draw everything quite blank, and that man
just lights one of his everlasting cigarettes
and walks up and down his room in front
of us and gets the thing first try—talks it
out—even thinks it out before us.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of that, Parkyns? It’s
quite as likely he’d thought it all out beforehand
and made inquiries himself, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
just sends us to look for what he knew we
should find.”</p>

<p>“He may have begun it, but he’d never
have let you trip him up as to its not being
a man if he had done. He made a mistake
there, and Mr. Tempest doesn’t particularly
care about doing that.”</p>

<p>“No, I agree with you on that point—he
doesn’t. Still, the next move is to find
Mrs. Garnett, and I’ll tell you one certain
fact, Yardley, about her. The thing was
premeditated, so you may be quite certain
Garnett is an assumed name, and probably
a name assumed for the purpose of the
murder and consequently one that carried
no clue in itself.”</p>

<p>A few days later, Tempest and Parkyns
dropped across each other at the Old
Bailey, and the inspector told the barrister
what he had ascertained.</p>

<p>“Yes, I thought it would turn out that
way. Now, you’ve got to try to put your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
hands on Mrs. Garnett, and the only way I
see of your doing that is to find out some
woman who will answer and whose life
somehow touched that of Miss Stableford.
It’s a pretty little problem, inspector.
Here I must be off,” said the barrister, as
his clerk brought him word that the judge
was summing up in a case that preceded
one in which he was himself briefed.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> some time Yardley and Parkyns devoted
themselves diligently to the search
for Mrs. Garnett, but the effort proved like
seeking a needle in a bundle of hay. They
had nothing to go upon—no detail from
which they could make a start. The hotel
porters had not the smallest recollection of
the lady’s departure, and could give no
hint how she had left the hotel nor what
might have been her destination.</p>

<p>At length, Yardley, confessing himself
conquered, applied to Tempest.</p>

<p>“I know it isn’t fair to come bothering
you,” he had said to the barrister; “but the
thing’s beaten me. If it were ordinary
professional work of mine, I should just
report a failure and drop it. I really don’t
think it’s any good worrying over it any
more, and Parkyns says he’s had enough of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
it too. But you sent for me to go to the inquest,
and you say you are interested, so I
decided I would see you again before actually
reporting to Lady Stableford.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure I can help you much. I’m
certainly not going to drop it myself, but
I don’t at present see how I can put you
much further along the road at present.
Still, there’s one point. You remember
what I suggested as the reason Miss Stableford’s
body was stripped?”</p>

<p>“You said it was an attempt to hide her
identity; and that if we could find any person
upon whom suspicion attached, merely
because the body was that of Miss Stableford,
that we should then have a clue.
That was what you said, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, exactly. But you couldn’t find
any such person in relation to Miss Stableford?”</p>

<p>“No, we couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s a suggestion. I tell you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
frankly, I don’t think it could be substantiated
in court. I don’t give it to you as
a certain deduction—it’s only a suggestion.
The only mystery you can learn of in connection
with Miss Stableford is the mystery
of her birth.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is so.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, it’s pretty certain that the
murderer of Miss Stableford was a woman—this
Mrs. Garnett.”</p>

<p>“Granted. What next?”</p>

<p>The barrister paused. “How old was
Mrs. Garnett? The hotel people say middle-aged,
forty to forty-five.”</p>

<p>“Old enough to be Miss Stableford’s
mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the girl was a bit short of twenty-one.”</p>

<p>“Well, Yardley, suppose you’ve got it
now?”</p>

<p>“What on earth do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Suppose Mrs. Garnett were Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
Stableford’s mother, she would naturally
be concerned in the mystery of the girl’s
birth? Yardley, I tell you, if you can find
out who was that girl’s mother, you’ll be a
big step onwards towards finding out the
clue to this mystery. I am fairly certain
you will know then who Mrs. Garnett is.”</p>

<p>“Whatever made you think of that,
Tempest?”</p>

<p>The barrister made no answer as he
walked to the table, picked up a cigarette
and lighted it. Apparently he had dismissed
the subject from his mind. His
next question had no relation to it.</p>

<p>“Have you done anything in the Rellingham
murder case, Yardley?”</p>

<p>“How did you know I was working on
it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I advised them to retain you.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re in that as well, are you,
Tempest?”</p>

<p>“It all depends what you mean by ‘in’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
it. I’m not hunting for the murderer, if
that’s what you mean.”</p>

<p>“But you know all about it?”</p>

<p>“I do. What did they tell you, Yardley?
You can speak frankly, for I know
all there is to be known about it, and I’m
curious to know how much they disclosed
to you.”</p>

<p>“I think they told me all they knew
themselves.”</p>

<p>“About the secret trust?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they told me that;” and Yardley
briefly recapitulated the details Tempest
already knew.</p>

<p>“I’m glad they told you, Yardley, else
I should have had to hold my tongue.
You’ve seen the letter Sir John wrote?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a copy,” and the detective produced
it from his letter-case. “Can you
give me any tips about that? I want some
badly, though I’m not at the end of my
tether with that case yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“Well, Yardley, there’s one very curious
sentence. Sir John says that if the
eventuality the trust is to provide for
doesn’t turn up in one hundred years from
the 18th of August, 1881, it never will.
What do you make of that?”</p>

<p>“If you want to know my candid opinion,
I think it’s all damned rot! I believe
Sir John was insane, and I’ve been interviewing
his doctors. I can’t say they welcome
the suggestion, but that’s what I
think. Look here, Tempest, how can you
call such a trust sane? Did you ever hear
of one like it before? It just seems wildly
preposterous to me. I think the fact that
he could create such a trust—the will’s all
in his own handwriting, so he couldn’t
have had advice—is just the best proof you
could want to demonstrate the truth of his
insanity.”</p>

<p>“Yardley, I’m a lawyer—you aren’t.
You can take it from me—even if it were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
not a judgment in court—that the trust is
legal, and I think it is perfectly sane. The
difficulty is this. Sir John had to deal
with a secret, and he did his best to make
that secret sacred. But Sir John knew
nothing apparently about deduction, for
it’s possible to get a good deal of explanation
out of the thing as it stands. All I am
doubtful about is how far one is justified in
trying to find any explanation at all. You
see, he leaves things to his partners, trusting
blindly in their honour and integrity,
and they accept the matter as sacred. I
don’t blame them. It’s what they ought to
do. They retain me in one way and you
in another, and they disclose to us what they
decline to make public. You see, you and
I in all decency—paid by them, working
in their interests—must adopt their standpoint.
If they are not justified in ferretting,
neither are we.”</p>

<p>“Well, Tempest, your morality is chalks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
above mine; but take it as you say, I don’t
see what you are driving at.”</p>

<p>“I’m simply trying to decide what is the
point at which we must stop; but I think
we are justified in going this far. It seems
to me pretty certain Sir John was considering
the honour or the reputation of some
third party.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. I’ll admit that, if you bar
insanity, I think the same.”</p>

<p>“Very well; that’s one step. Now, he
speaks of an interval of one hundred years.
What can you connect one hundred years
with?”</p>

<p>“It’s a blooming century, if that’s any
help.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t, Yardley. To be perfectly candid,
I have racked my brains for days over
it, and I can think of nothing in which one
hundred years from any given date is an
integral and essential part of any fact, idea,
or supposition.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“Well, Tempest, if you can’t think of
anything, I’m willing to bet there is nothing.”</p>

<p>“I distrust your premise, but I agree
with your conclusion, Yardley. What I
believe is that it is an outside interval
which is sufficient for one to be certain it
covers some other known but uncertain interval.
Now, what does a hundred years
cover?”</p>

<p>“As much as charity. I’ve no doubt
you’ve settled it to your own satisfaction.
Go on; don’t wait for me.”</p>

<p>“Well, Yardley, I think I can tell you.
What’s the length of a man’s life?”</p>

<p>“‘The days of our years shall be three
score years and ten, and if by reason of
strength they be four score years’—there,
you’ve got Bible authority for that, Mr.
Tempest.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. An interval of one hundred
years is bound to embrace and cover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
the whole period of any person’s life—to
include his birth and his death.”</p>

<p>“How about the centenarians?”</p>

<p>“They are too rare to take into consideration.”</p>

<p>“Well, take it then, Tempest, that you
are right. The hundred years is to cover
some person’s life. Whose?”</p>

<p>“The life of some person born on the
18th of August, 1881. Now, Yardley, who
was born on that day?”</p>

<p>“Really, I’m not the Registrar-General.”</p>

<p>“No, of course not; but I wouldn’t give
tuppence for your memory, my dear Yardley.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go on; don’t beat about the bush.
Take it for granted I’m as stupid as an owl.
I assure you I feel I am when I’m talking
to you.”</p>

<p>The barrister laughed, and, taking his
cigarette from his mouth, he watched it as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
the smoke curled away from the burning
end.</p>

<p>“Yardley, the water-tight compartments
of your mind get locked a bit too tightly.
The 18th of August, 1881, is probably—pretty
certainly—the date of the birth of
Evangeline Stableford. At any rate that
is the date of the birth of the child which
was offered to Lady Stableford for adoption,
and the probabilities are overwhelming
that the child that was planted on her
was that child.”</p>

<p>“Then do you mean to say Mrs. Garnett
murdered Sir John as well?”</p>

<p>The barrister’s eyes half closed, and he
spoke slowly and deliberately.</p>

<p>“No, Yardley, I don’t; but mark you,
I do say this, that that secret trust refers to
Evangeline Stableford, and that Sir John
was safeguarding the honour of that girl’s
mother, and her mother I am pretty certain
was Mrs. Garnett. Now, find the explanation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
of the one, and you’ve explained the
other. The two mysteries are one and the
same; of that I’m positive. What we have
got to do is to trace Mrs. Garnett, and find
out who she is. The more I think of it
the more convinced I am that the papers
Sir John left, which have been destroyed,
would give us the clue. But this also I am
certain of, that they were never preserved
to clear up murder mysteries.”</p>

<p>“What do you really think, Tempest?”</p>

<p>“No; that’s not fair. I’ve told you
what I feel certain about—the things that
it seems to me one is justified in arriving at
by pure deduction, and justified in acting
upon. What I’ve told you already I’ll
stand to. Anything beyond that is just
guessing, for which I won’t be held responsible.”</p>

<p>“Quite so; but what do you guess?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you will treat this as no more
than a guess, and not bracket it as equally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
a certainty with all the rest that I’ve told
you, I don’t mind your knowing what I do
think. I believe that Miss Stableford was
the daughter of Sir John and Mrs. Garnett,
and that the secret trust is an attempt
by Sir John to secure that his daughter
should be provided for.”</p>

<p>“But that doesn’t explain his death or
hers?”</p>

<p>“I grant you that: and that’s precisely
why I doubt the accuracy of my guess.
Still, it’s the only logical conclusion I have
argued out so far. Look here, Yardley.
Take it for granted that Miss Stableford
was Sir John’s daughter. He can disclose
his own position as the father, but he stands
to hurt his daughter by labelling her a bastard,
and he also stands to damage her
mother by labelling her to be immoral.
Now, either risk is considerable whilst the
two women are alive. Neither matters
twopence when they are both dead. Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
John must have known Evangeline was for
the present well provided for. The probability
was that Lady Stableford would
leave her a fortune, and in that case no further
provision would be necessary. With
that probability it was, it would certainly
be, a positive shame to label Evangeline
Stableford as illegitimate or her mother as
immoral. It would be so absolutely unnecessary.”</p>

<p>“But, steady on, Tempest, how on earth
was Sir John to be sure Lady Stableford
would leave the girl a fortune? Suppose
the girl had lived, and Lady Stableford
had left her nothing? How was Sir John
to know? How were his partners to know
from what you presume—assume it all to
be true—that the occasion had arisen when
the trust came into operation?”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t know.”</p>

<p>“Then your argument falls to the
ground?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“No, Yardley, it doesn’t. Your remark
takes it one step further forward.”</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?”</p>

<p>“Assume it all to be true, then something
else has to be done to bring about the occasion
for the intervention of the trust. You
can argue it out, and think it over till the
crack of doom, Yardley, but I am positive
that that trust cannot come into operation
by mere fortuitous circumstance. Somebody
else has still got to do something;
therefore, Yardley, mark this—there is
somebody else alive now who knows the
whole of the circumstances which were
known to Sir John, and that somebody else
will create at the proper time, <i>if it be necessary</i>,
such an occasion that resort to the
trust will be essential. That person is the
person whose honour Sir John was safeguarding.
Now, that person’s honour is
precious in his or her lifetime—it will matter
little or nothing after death. Therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
the other person was watching Miss
Stableford’s career. If Evangeline had
been provided for by Lady Stableford,
nothing would ever have been done. But
supposing the old lady had left her unprovided
for, then that person by his or her
will could and was intended to disclose
sufficient to bring the trust into operation
for the benefit of Evangeline. You can
discuss the thing for a century, Yardley,
but you will find that it is the only logical
conclusion you can come to on what we
know. It’s the only one possible.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t Sir John simply hand over
£20,000 in his lifetime to Miss Stableford?
It could have been done anonymously, if
there were any secret to be guarded.”</p>

<p>“Very likely he meant to when she came
of age. Don’t forget she died a minor.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, why didn’t he hand the
money to this other person whom you say
knows everything and is now alive?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“I don’t know, Yardley; but it was
probably because he didn’t trust that person.
He did trust his partners. Look
here, there are scores of people in this
world who can be trusted to do a specified
thing who are absolute fools over money.
They are not necessarily dishonest. It
simply is that they muddle money away.
Pay it all into a single banking account,
and find to their horror, when it is too late,
that they have overdrawn their accounts.
That’s how half the trust funds which are
lost go. That is what Sir John was afraid
of.”</p>

<p>“Who do you think that other person is,
Tempest?”</p>

<p>“You can take it for granted Sir John
never gave away a client in his life. The
child’s mother is bound to have known. I
expect that other person was the mother.</p>

<p>“Still, after all, Yardley,” said the barrister,
as he helped himself to another cigarette<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
from his case, “you see, if it were
merely the providing for the welfare of a
certain person, there are hundreds of ways
in which this could have been done without
exciting any suspicion at all. Sir John
was a clever lawyer, and knew of those
ways. The secret trust was so unnecessary.
Therefore, though I am still inclined to
think my guess correct, I’m certain that if
it be correct, there is a lot more to come
out. You see, it is quite possible no provision
will ever be claimed under the trust—which
makes one doubt the daughter idea.
What we know or can guess won’t properly
explain everything. Yardley, you must
find out Mrs. Garnett and who she is.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you set me something easier to
do? Working with you somehow always
seems to involve these forlorn hopes, wild-goose
sort of hunts. How <i>am</i> I to find the
woman?”</p>

<p>“God knows, Yardley; I don’t. I think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
the most likely way would be to trace the
birth of Miss Stableford.”</p>

<p>“But we’ve tried that, and failed.”</p>

<p>“I know; but we’ve only tried England.
I’ve never been in such a position myself,
and perhaps I don’t know, but it’s always a
standing mystery to me, why the illegitimate
child of a woman who wants to cover
up its birth is ever born in England. A
few pounds take you over to France, where
not a soul knows you. The mother can
call herself Mrs. anybody, and register the
child as the child of any father or a mythical
father, if you like. The fraud couldn’t
possibly come out till afterwards, when the
mother is safe back in England. I’ve
never looked it up, but I doubt if they
would extradite for such an offence. It’s
forgery here by Act of Parliament, but I
don’t suppose it is in France.”</p>

<p>“You might say the same of any country
in Europe?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“Yes, I agree; but don’t forget the child
was only ten days old when it was left with
Lady Stableford. The baby was already
born, for her sex was disclosed when the
first letter was written to Lady Stableford.
Between the date at which the lady disclosed
her name and address and her finding
of the child, there was no time for the
infant to have been brought from any great
distance. The baby was probably born
in France.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it’s worth while going to
France and making inquiries there?”</p>

<p>“Hardly; for the odds are 20,000 to one
against the birth being registered in the
correct or any genuine name. Nor do we
know what name to look for. Obviously
it couldn’t be Stableford.”</p>

<p>“Up against a blank wall again. Which
way round are you going?”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got the remarkable likeness
between Evangeline Stableford and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
Dolores Alvarez. Dolores was certainly
not the child’s mother. She had never had
a child; but it’s worth your while to work
out the Alvarez pedigree, for I shall be
everlastingly surprised if there proves to
have been no blood relationship at all between
the two women. I don’t promise
you that you’ll find the solution; but that’s
the only channel I think of at present, and
it’s worth trying. Still, there’s one other
alternative. Suppose Sir John is trying to
protect the honour of a man, and that the
child is not his at all? Suppose Sir John
himself were only a trustee, and that he did
not create the trust, but only passed it on?”</p>

<p>“Suppose indeed, Tempest! However
do you think of things as you do?”</p>

<p>“Think! One can’t help thinking. The
alternatives jump at you. But you can
take it for granted that if Sir John were
protecting a man, that man was no ordinary
client. Any man will go to any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
lengths in the interests of a woman, particularly
if she be a pretty woman; but I’m
hanged if I think many men would go to
the bother Sir John did simply in the interests
of a man. Besides, a man’s interests
never get so important in this avenue
that they are worth such procedure. In
fact, it is hardly a very likely solution.”</p>

<p>“Tempest, suppose her father were a
king?”</p>

<p>“I’ve thought of that, but then kings’
mistresses are always the wives of other
men, who father their children for them.
Added to which, Yardley, a king lives his
life so much in the open that his bastards
are known to many people, often to all the
world. They can’t be hidden up. No, it
isn’t a king. Do you remember the story
of poor Parnell? It’s always been a mystery
to me that the Irish have ever tolerated
the English Liberal Party since. The
Irish were more powerful under Parnell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
than they have ever been before or since.
Yet they let the Radical Nonconformist
conscience fire the ultimatum at them that
they must throw Parnell over. And so they
broke him and broke themselves. It was
such sickening cant—that ultimatum.
Yardley, she was far more likely to be the
child of a man in the position of Parnell
than the child of a king. You see, a king
is not dependent on public support for his
position. A public man is, and the whole
of his private life is expected to be white
as driven snow. If it isn’t, he’s got to
whitewash over the shady places till the
public can’t spot them. And that takes
some doing. What I doubt is that Sir
John would lend himself to it. You see,
both the alternatives are unlikely. Which
is the least unlikely?”</p>

<p>“Hanged if I know!”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t, Yardley. As far as
we know at present, it’s just a case of ‘you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
pays your money and you takes your
choice.’”</p>

<p>“Tempest, what sort of a man was Sir
John?”</p>

<p>“Can’t tell you. I’ve seen him in court
a few times. Just knew the old boy to nod
to, but that’s all. I never held a brief for
him. You see, he was one of the beastly
respectable sort of solicitor. A divorce
case or anything nasty or criminal he’d
send on at once to another firm. Nice
stodgy conveyancing, chancery work or
family trust deeds and things of that kind
were all he would do. He was a splendid
father to unregenerate cubs.”</p>

<p>“And all the time—as likely as not—he
was a hot ’un at home, eh?”</p>

<p>“May have been, for all I know; but I
never heard a whisper of that kind of thing
about him. He wasn’t a Wesleyan or a
class leader or any other advertised kind of
humbug. He would play cards at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
club. I’ve seen him at Ascot and Good-wood.
He was a great first-nighter, and
all that sounds pretty decent and ordinary.”</p>

<p>“Have you asked his partners if he had
any private clients?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did. They know of none. As
far as they are aware, all the business he
did went through the office in the regular
way. Occasionally he would press-copy a
letter himself in a private letter-book he
kept. But Baxter has been through that,
and he says there is nothing suspicious in
it and nothing the other partners didn’t
know about.”</p>

<p>“Then why did he keep the letter-book
private?”</p>

<p>“Baxter told me that the letters certainly
were private—the sort of letters you
wouldn’t let the office boy see, but nothing
more than that.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see that book, Tempest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“So should I. But in the face of what
Baxter says, I hardly see how we could
press the point. We mustn’t let them get
the idea that we are merely curious, or they
will all just shut up like oysters. Still,
Baxter isn’t a fool; and if he says it
wouldn’t help us, the probabilities certainly
are that he is right. To sum it
all up, Yardley, you’ve got the mystery of
the death of Sir John, the mystery of the
secret trust, and the mystery of the death of
Miss Stableford, and I am convinced that
all the lot are really only one mystery. But
all the same, we haven’t got the explanation
of that mystery.”</p>

<p>Some days later, Arthur Baxter came
round to Tempest’s chambers.</p>

<p>“I haven’t any idea,” he said, “whether
there is anything in it or not, but you asked
me about Sir John’s private letter-book.
Yesterday I found a letter had been copied
in it which I had never previously noticed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
and as I can’t explain it, and as neither of
my partners know or can even guess to
what it refers, we three have all come to
the conclusion that you had better be told
about it, in case there may be any clue to be
got from it.”</p>

<p>“How did you come to miss it before?”</p>

<p>“Well, the old boy didn’t copy it following
on the others. It was on a page quite
by itself, very nearly at the end of the book.
I was looking in the index. I wanted some
figures from a certain letter which I knew
Sir John had copied in his own book, and
I came across the reference ‘S. T. 477.’
Now, it is a 500-page letter-book. The
last copied letter is on page 304. Naturally
we didn’t look on through a lot of
blank pages, and so we missed it. I can’t
imagine why he copied it there and not in
its proper place.”</p>

<p>“Probably he half meant to tear it out.
It was most likely copied for <i>temporary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
reference</i>, and when the opportunity for its
use was over he probably intended to destroy
it. That would be why it was only
indexed under initials.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose ‘S. T.’ means?”</p>

<p>“Secret trust, I should guess. Would
that fit the letter? Let me see it,” said
Tempest.</p>

<p>“Well, here’s a copy of it.”</p>

<p>“Sir John Rellingham has received and
carefully considered the letter. In the exercise
of his discretion he must decline the
request. He cannot but think that the interview
is essential.”</p>

<p>“Who was it written to?”</p>

<p>“There isn’t a hint, and it isn’t dated.”</p>

<p>“When was it written?”</p>

<p>“Some time during the week before his
death.”</p>

<p>“How can you prove that?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s rather funny. The copying-ink
we used to use in the office was a sticky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
purple kind of stuff. But we changed to
Stephen’s blue-black copying-ink for some
reason or other a week before he died, and
this letter was written in the new ink.”</p>

<p>“Did Sir John open his own letters at
the office?”</p>

<p>“No, the confidential clerk opened
everything addressed to anybody. It was
the understood thing amongst the lot of us
that everything that arrived at that address
must be the common interest and knowledge
of the firm, so nobody used the address
for his private purposes.”</p>

<p>“But suppose a letter marked ‘<i>Private</i>,’
and addressed to one of you personally
arrived. What would happen?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Smith would open it!”</p>

<p>“Has Smith seen this copy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he says no letters arrived at
the office for Sir John, within the last
month of his life, that this could possibly
have related to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“Then Sir John must have received it at
his own address?”</p>

<p>“That’s probable. You see, the letter
carries over to the second page. Sir John’s
private notepaper (he kept some at the office)
would fit this letter. The office paper
won’t. So much of our stuff is typewritten
that all the office paper is the single sheet,
square quarto stuff. Our paper never does
carry over, because one sheet is one page.
Therefore, as he used his private notepaper,
with his own address on, to answer it, I
should guess it was a reply to a letter which
had reached him at home.”</p>

<p>“Baxter, I suppose you haven’t found
any letters this could possibly be a reply
to?”</p>

<p>“No, there’s nothing. I’ve been through
all the letters in his pocket, or that came to
the office during the last ten days of his
life, and there was nothing at his house.
It couldn’t possibly fit anything. Still,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
Sir John often said that the safest place for
a secret was in the fire.”</p>

<p>“Then we had better take it that whatever
letter it was a reply to has been destroyed?”</p>

<p>“That seems pretty certainly so. Tempest,
can’t you think of any explanation?
Can’t you unravel the business? They say
you’ve never failed with any one of these
murder cases that you’ve tackled. Why
have you failed us?”</p>

<p>“No, Baxter, that isn’t cricket. I’m not
a detective, and I never undertook to play
detective for you. When I have had to
get a prisoner off, there’s precious little I
stick at. I’ve done all that lay to my hand.
I’ve sometimes gone out of my way and
done a bit more, but I don’t undertake to
do detective work.”</p>

<p>“Tempest, for God’s sake have pity on
us! Since this bother cropped up, forty-five
clients have formally removed their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
business from us. Goodness only knows
how many more have quietly dropped us
without making a fuss and intend never to
come back. In twelve months’ time we
shan’t have a client left. I’m not married,
no more is Marston, and he’s young, but
Moorhouse has a wife and family. It’s serious
enough for all of us, but it’s Gehenna
for him. Can’t you suggest something?
What do you think?”</p>

<p>Tempest and the solicitor walked out of
Lincoln’s Inn together, and slowly across
the fields, and as they went the barrister repeated
the story he had argued out with
Yardley.</p>

<p>The solicitor stopped and turned and
faced the other man on the pavement.</p>

<p>“Tempest, you were present when that
trust case was on. Do you remember that
woman in court, sitting by herself, heavily
veiled at the back, and we wondered what
brought her there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“Remember! Damn! damn! damn!
Why didn’t I think of it? What an asinine
fool I was. That must have been
Mrs. Garnett. Baxter, why don’t you kick
me?”</p>

<p>“I ought to be kicked myself. We were
a pair of fools.”</p>

<p>“That explains why she was so interested.
Yes, she wanted to know about the
trust.”</p>

<p>“Tempest, had you thought all this out
when that case was on? If you had, then
I will kick you.”</p>

<p>“No, old man, I hadn’t. I was arguing
it out with Yardley a few days ago. To be
perfectly frank, I tried to put a certain
proposition to him, and he kept on objecting
and objecting; and all the time, as I
was explaining away his objections to him,
I was step by step arguing myself further
on. That’s the real truth.”</p>

<p>“I wish we had got hold of that woman.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
Her presence in court that day seems to
confirm your theory, Tempest.”</p>

<p>“Baxter, go back to your office and make
inquiries whether any of your clients have
altered their wills since the date of Evangeline
Stableford’s death.”</p>

<p>“I’ve asked that already. We know of
no alteration of a will by any client. Of
course, we’ve made a good many wills
since; but, as far as I can find out, none of
them are for any client for whom we held
a previous one. But Sir John was a clever
lawyer, and I don’t for one moment suppose
that the firm would hold such a will
as you suppose exists, if we held the other
ends of the tangled thread, as apparently
we do. It’s all amazingly funny, Tempest.”</p>

<p>“I think it is,” began the barrister, as
with his eyes on the ground he slowly
paced on along the pavement.</p>

<p>“I’ve a warrant for your arrest, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
Baxter!” and both the men turned, as
an inspector of police, overtaking them,
placed his hand on the solicitor’s arm.</p>

<p>“It’s really come, then?” he gasped, as
he turned, his face blanching deathly pale.</p>

<p>“Damn you, Baxter! hold your tongue!”
said Tempest, whose mind, accustomed to
criminal work, at once saw the danger of
the ghastly remark the solicitor had made.
“Robson,” he added, for he recognised the
inspector, “what’s this arrest for?”</p>

<p>“Murder of Sir John Rellingham, sir.”</p>

<p>“But I understood Parkyns had got that
case in hand?”</p>

<p>“So he has, Mr. Tempest. I’m simply
making the arrest for him. He’s ill in
bed.”</p>

<p>“What’s your evidence, Robson?”</p>

<p>“There’s a lot, Mr. Tempest—all that
secret trust business.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s only the halfpenny rag stuff!
You haven’t arrested Mr. Baxter on that.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
What’s turned up fresh? Come on—out
with it. You’ll have to tell the magistrate
under twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Tempest, a revolver has
been found in Mr. Baxter’s rooms, with
one chamber empty, whilst the other bullets
match the one Sir John Rellingham
was killed with.”</p>

<p>“It’s a——” began the solicitor, but
Tempest’s hand closed on his arm like a
vice. “Be quiet,” he said; adding, “I
can’t do much before the magistrate, but
I’ll be there.”</p>

<p>“Tempest, try and get me bail?”</p>

<p>“Hopeless, old man. It’s a charge of
murder.”</p>

<p>The inspector formally gave his prisoner
the usual warning; and Tempest asked,
“Where are you going to charge him?”</p>

<p>“Bow Street, sir.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Now, at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>“Then I’ll come along with you.”</p>

<p>The clerk of a friend of Tempest’s
passed at the moment, and the barrister
stopped him. “Just go into my chambers,
and tell my clerk to come along to me at
Bow Street at once, will you?”</p>

<p>The three men got into a four-wheeler,
and were rapidly driven to the police station.
A few minutes of brief formality
and Arthur Baxter was charged before the
magistrate and remanded. Evidence of
arrest and of the finding of the revolver
was given.</p>

<p>Tempest knew that, as the necessity for
further investigations had been alleged, it
was purposeless to try to break up the case
at that stage, and he merely contented himself
with reserving his cross-examination of
the witness.</p>

<p>The inspector asked for a search warrant,
to enable a search to be made of the
offices of the firm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>Tempest at once objected, pleading the
privilege of the solicitor.</p>

<p>“Is there any case on this point, Mr.
Tempest?” said the magistrate. “It seems
rather an interesting one.”</p>

<p>“I know of none, sir; and, even if there
were, his partners could plead the same
privilege.”</p>

<p>The inspector urged the necessity of the
search strongly, but Tempest strenuously
objected.</p>

<p>“I am not sure you are not right, Mr.
Tempest. Still, it’s a point that ought to
be authoritatively settled. Would you be
content if I grant the application of the
inspector, subject to an undertaking that no
attempt to execute it is made till your appeal
is decided? I suppose you will appeal?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Then that is how it had better stand.”</p>

<p>“But papers may be destroyed meanwhile,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
your worship?” objected the inspector.</p>

<p>“You must take that risk, inspector. It
doesn’t amount to much, for if there ever
were anything compromising, I’ve no
doubt it was destroyed long ago. Still, it’s
an interesting point that ought to be settled.
Who issued the search warrant for
Mr. Baxter’s rooms, inspector?”</p>

<p>“That was done at Scotland Yard, your
worship. But because of this privilege I
was told to apply to you, sir, for this other
warrant.”</p>

<p>“Quite so—quite so,” assented the magistrate,
and Arthur Baxter was led away to
the cells.</p>

<p>“Mr. Tempest,” said the magistrate, as
the barrister, picking up his hat and stick,
was preparing to leave the court, “I’ve no
doubt this appeal will take some time. I
quite appreciate the reason why you did
not ask for bail. It is never ordinarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
granted in a charge of murder. But <i>prima
facie</i> it seems so unlikely that anyone in the
position of Mr. Baxter would be likely to
be guilty of the crime, that I look with a
good deal of apprehension at the possibility
of retaining an innocent man in custody
until that appeal can be argued. Between
now and next week you will doubtless have
an opportunity of consulting your client;
and if you find there is any really satisfactory
explanation of the discovery of the revolver,
and you are in a position to then
substantiate it with proper evidence, I am
at present inclined to think I might favourably
consider an application for bail, providing
there is not then any additional evidence.
But, of course, it will need to be
very substantial bail.”</p>

<p>“I’ll undertake it shall be forthcoming
to any amount, sir,” answered the barrister.</p>

<p>The next day Tempest had an interview<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
with the prisoner. “Now, how about this
revolver?” he asked.</p>

<p>“My dear man, I know no more about
it than you do. I’ve never had a revolver
in my hand in my life, much less fired one.
I never put it there. I never knew it was
there.”</p>

<p>“The inspector swore he found it in
your empty suit-case in your bedroom.
When did you last use your suit-case?”</p>

<p>“About a fortnight before Sir John was
shot. I stayed a week-end with the Trelawneys
at Ashover.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you been away from town
since?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; but I’ve got a larger case,
which I generally use.”</p>

<p>“Who unpacked for you when you came
back from Ashover?”</p>

<p>“My man, Bailey.”</p>

<p>“Well, the inspector says the suit-case
was not locked—just strapped.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>“That’s how it always is. Do you think
the police put it there, Tempest?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. Parkyns was present when
Robson found it. I know Parkyns well,
and I’d trust him anywhere. Besides, the
police don’t do that kind of thing. They
try to get convictions, of course; and if a
simple constable makes a mistake he can always
get his pals to come and back him up.
But higher up in the force they wouldn’t
even do that. They are a fine lot of men.
Can you trust Bailey?”</p>

<p>“If I find I can’t, I’ll never believe in
anyone else so long as I live. I’d have
cheerfully trusted my life to him.”</p>

<p>“Well, Baxter, it’s simply this, unless
that revolver can be explained it won’t be
much good asking for bail. Can you suggest
anything? I’ll go and cross-question
Bailey, and I’ll see if Parkyns will tell me
whether the police have found out where it
was purchased. That may help us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>The barrister left the prison, puzzled
and troubled. After the broad hint the
magistrate had given him it was disheartening
to him as an advocate, and damning
to his client, that he could put forward no
explanation.</p>

<p>He went straight to Baxter’s rooms and
interviewed Bailey. As he had expected,
he learned that, of course, the revolver
was not in the case when Bailey had unpacked
it.</p>

<p>“Did you lock it up then?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; just strapped it. To be quite
frank, Mr. Baxter has lost the key of it.
That happened years ago. If he ever uses
it he always takes it in the railway carriage
with him.”</p>

<p>“Were you in the room when the police
found it?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“Bailey, what are Mr. Baxter’s arrangements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
here? Who are the other servants?”</p>

<p>“There’s only my wife and myself, sir.
It’s quite a small flat. The dining-room,
the sitting-room, the kitchen, and three
bedrooms.”</p>

<p>“Is it ever left entirely empty?”</p>

<p>“Not as a rule, sir; if one’s out the
other’s in. Mr. Baxter makes a point of
that, unless sometimes when he’s been in
himself he’s told me to take my wife out
for a walk.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s never been quite empty?”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t say that. Some time ago
my wife’s mother was very ill, and she went
home to nurse her. You know, sir, I used
to be soldier-servant to Mr. Baxter’s
brother—the one who was killed in South
Africa. He was in the Army Service
Corps. So I could do most things. So
Mr. Baxter said that if I could manage his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
breakfasts he would dine out till my wife
came back. That was how we managed
it; but, of course, I often had to run out to
do shopping, and then the flat would be
empty.”</p>

<p>“There would be the chance then that
somebody could enter the flat without you
knowing?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, at those times.”</p>

<p>“But you wouldn’t leave the flat unlocked?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, of course not; but there was
only the one latch;” and the man led the
way to the door.</p>

<p>Tempest wondered at the array of bolts
and chains which was there, and doubtless
brought into use every night when three
people were sleeping in the flat; whilst all
the time a single drop latch was the only
protection when the place was unoccupied.</p>

<p>“Who carries the key?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“There are two, sir. I carry one and
Mr. Baxter has one.”</p>

<p>“Has yours ever left your possession?”</p>

<p>“Never, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, Bailey, unless you or your master
are hiding something from me, the explanation
of this revolver business must
come from you. Can you suggest anything?
Look here, I’m on Mr. Baxter’s
side, so you needn’t mind what you say to
me. Tell me anything you know or can
think of—no matter how black it looks.
The truth always helps, no matter what it
is, when a prisoner is innocent.”</p>

<p>The man hesitated, and Tempest saw at
once there was something to come out.
He began once or twice in a stammering
way, and then stopped.</p>

<p>“Now, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Please, sir, perhaps you ought to know
Sir John Rellingham came here the day
before he was murdered.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“Came here! Whatever for?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir.”</p>

<p>“What time of day?”</p>

<p>“About nine o’clock in the evening, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, why shouldn’t he?”</p>

<p>“No reason at all, sir—only what he said
when he left.”</p>

<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>“I think Mr. Baxter was trying to persuade
him to something; for, as he stood in
the doorway, I heard Sir John say—‘No,
Arthur; don’t say any more. It’s quite
final. I will not; I can’t;’ and then I let
him out and called a cab for him.”</p>

<p>The barrister’s face grew grave. “Had
there been a quarrel?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, sir. They didn’t seem to have
been quarrelling. They seemed to part
quite friends, but they had had a long argument.
I could hear that much.”</p>

<p>Tempest turned away and moodily
walked down the stairs. What had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
the point of difference between the two
men? When he got back to his chambers
in Lincoln’s Inn he found a note from Inspector
Parkyns.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—In reply to your inquiry,
there is no reason at all why I should not
tell you. All identification marks on the
revolver have been carefully filed out, and
we are quite unable to trace it.—Yours respectfully,
<span class="smcap">S. Parkyns</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Another clue had failed.</p>

<p>When Baxter was again brought up at
Bow Street, Tempest was compelled to admit
he could at present offer no explanation
of the presence of the revolver in the prisoner’s
rooms. Not only had he failed in
this direction, but evidence was now given
by the bankers of Sir John Rellingham,
that since the death of Sir John a bill for
£2000 had been presented for payment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
purporting to bear his signature as acceptor.
They had never previously known
Sir John to accept a bill, and his current
credit balance was always so large that it
seemed strange he should have done so on
this occasion. They had also grave doubt
as to the signature. The bill had been
presented by a well-known firm of money-lenders,
whose endorsement appeared on
the back. A member of the firm in question,
when called to give evidence, deposed
that three months previously they had had
dealings with the prisoner, who, professing
to be acting for a client, had taken up
before maturity a bill bearing the signature
of a well-known peer. They had had
doubts as to the genuineness of that particular
signature, but had discounted it on the
strength of the name with which it was endorsed.</p>

<p>Tempest left his seat and went over to
the dock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“Baxter, is this true?” he asked in a low
tone.</p>

<p>“Perfectly true. I did deal with them,
but I was acting for Lord Deverell, and I
did it at his request.”</p>

<p>“Then the papers in the office will explain
that?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not. He came and called
on us, and I saw him. The bill was only
£500, and he brought the money in gold.
He seemed very upset and anxious about
it, so I went off there and then to Isaacson’s—got
the bill, and Lord Deverell
waited in my room whilst I was away.
Consequently there was no note of any kind
made about the case. He asked me not to,
in fact, and he burnt the bill in my room as
soon as he got it back.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll charge him for doing it,
won’t you? It will be in your ledger or
somewhere?”</p>

<p>“No. You see, we do all his estate business—that’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
hundreds a year. So as he
seemed very anxious there should be no
record made of the case I let it slide. I told
Marston and Moorhouse, and they quite
agreed.”</p>

<p>“Well, we shall have to get Lord Deverell
to give evidence for you.”</p>

<p>“He died three weeks ago.”</p>

<p>Tempest returned to his seat to cross-examine
the money-lender.</p>

<p>“How did you get that bill?”</p>

<p>“We discounted it in the ordinary course
of business.”</p>

<p>“For whom did you discount it?”</p>

<p>“It was brought to us with this letter,”
and the witness produced a letter for inspection.
It was handed to the magistrate,
who passed it on to Tempest for inspection.
To his amazement he saw that it was written
on the notepaper of the firm of Rellingham,
Baxter, Marston &amp; Moorhouse—obviously
in a disguised handwriting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>The note merely stated that the firm
were requested by one of their clients to
ask Messrs. Isaacson to discount the bill enclosed
on the best terms they could, and
hand the proceeds to the bearer.</p>

<p>“Who was the bearer?” asked counsel.
The witness was unable to say. He had
assumed it was one of the firm’s clerks. He
had not taken any particular notice of the
man.</p>

<p>“How did you get the other bill—the
one bearing Sir John Rellingham’s signature?”</p>

<p>“That reached us in the same way,
brought by a messenger with a note.”</p>

<p>“Have you got that note?”</p>

<p>The witness produced it. It was similar
to the other, but merely asked Messrs.
Isaacson to oblige the firm by discounting
it, saying that on behalf of a client the firm
had to find the money in the course of a few
hours, to meet a heavy payment, and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
client required time to realise money to
meet his liability.</p>

<p>“Was it the same messenger who
brought it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I didn’t see the man
myself.”</p>

<p>“Would your clerks know?”</p>

<p>“I hardly suppose so. They would
simply receive a note, and bring it in to me
in each case. There would be nothing in
either instance which would give them any
special reason to connect a given messenger
with any particular transaction. They
would know nothing of the transaction or
from whom the messenger came.”</p>

<p>“Would there be no entry they would
make in your books? Wouldn’t they be
aware of the transaction in that way?”</p>

<p>“I always keep my own books.”</p>

<p>“How did you pay these bills?”</p>

<p>“In bank notes.”</p>

<p>“Did you keep the numbers?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“Yes;” and the witness handed them in.</p>

<p>“Have the notes been traced?” asked
the magistrate.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’m going to call evidence,”
replied the prosecuting solicitor.</p>

<p>A bank clerk next proved the opening of
an account by a Mr. Everard Clarke, who
had given references. They had communicated
with the references given, and had
received satisfactory replies. All the notes
had been paid in by Mr. Clarke. In each
case the bulk of the money had been withdrawn
in gold shortly afterwards, but not
all in one sum. The account was now
practically closed. Their own charges
would more than absorb the small remaining
balance. They had since tried to trace
Mr. Clarke, but the address he had given
had proved fictitious, and the same with
his references—these, it was now found,
having been written from accommodation
addresses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“Could he recognise Mr. Clarke?”</p>

<p>“He was afraid not. He believed the
gentleman only came to the bank once—when
he opened the account.”</p>

<p>“Was it the prisoner?”</p>

<p>“I really couldn’t say. I don’t recognise
him.”</p>

<p>The barrister sat down in despair, and
the prisoner was again remanded. The
two men had an interview in the cells immediately
afterwards.</p>

<p>“Tempest,” immediately began the solicitor,
“those letters are absolute forgeries.
There isn’t one of us would have
dreamed of doing such a thing. If Lord
Deverell had wanted £500 he could have
had that much, or £5000, for the mere asking,
and we should have paid it out of
our current account. We are constantly
financing our clients, and we keep a big
floating balance for the purpose. Besides,
we should never have sent any client to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
Isaacson’s, and as for sending for £2000
for ourselves, it is ridiculous. Fancy a
firm of our standing touching such a
crowd or that kind of business!”</p>

<p>“How could they get your notepaper?”</p>

<p>“Easily enough. They could get a
heading engraved like ours for a few shillings,
if they could find a man they’d trust
to do it.”</p>

<p>“Baxter, what did Sir John go to your
rooms about the day before he was murdered?”</p>

<p>“Who told you that?”</p>

<p>“Bailey did.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was simple enough,” the solicitor
answered, speaking very slowly. “He—he
just came in for a smoke and a chat.”</p>

<p>“Baxter, that’s a lie, and you know it.
What was it that he refused to do?”</p>

<p>The other man flushed a dusky crimson.
“I’d asked him,” he stammered, “to help
me to float a little syndicate I was interested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
in. He said solicitors ought not to
gamble, and so he declined to have anything
to do with it.”</p>

<p>From his half-closed eyes Tempest
watched the other as he had invented the
story. He felt certain the tale was perfectly
untrue, and that the solicitor was
hiding something. What was that something?</p>

<p>Thinking it all out quietly afterwards,
Tempest came to the conclusion that,
whether Baxter were innocent or guilty,
probably the interview with Sir John had
no relation to his murder. Presuming that
it had, the motive for the crime was the
desire to profit financially by Sir John’s
death. The only financial matter that
could possibly be on the tapis, and be in
issue between Baxter and Sir John, involved
the supposition that Baxter had
forged Sir John’s signature and that Sir
John had found this out. Because the Deverell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
bill had been taken up and settled,
that matter was closed. But the two had
parted on quite friendly terms, an impossible
supposition if the one had discovered
that the other had forged his name. There
might be—as there probably were—many
private matters which Sir John and his
partner could have been discussing which
had no relation to the crime. But supposing
Baxter’s story were true as regards
his interview with Lord Deverell, then
there was fraud regarding the inception of
the matter in the forgery of the letter on
the strength of which the bill had been discounted.</p>

<p>Assuming that fraud, how had Lord
Deverell ever got to know of the existence
of the bill? Isaacson’s had admitted they
did not communicate with him. And why
had he wished to take up the bill? His
desire to do so was an admission of the signature.
Yet why, if that were so, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
Lord Deverell troubled to forge a letter
from his own solicitors? His own name
was on the bill, so there could be no question
of an attempt to cover up his identity
of his participation in the matter. His
interest in it being admitted, it would
have been simple enough for him to get it
discounted by his own bank, or even by
Isaacson’s, who would have jumped at the
chance of temporarily obliging a person of
his financial stability, even supposing it to
be necessary for him to draw a bill at all.
There were all these improbabilities in the
way of accepting Baxter’s own story. On
the other hand, the prosecution alleged that
Baxter had himself forged the bill, and
written the letter bearing his firm’s name,
and then had himself taken the bill up to
prevent its presentation. Against that
supposition there was only the character of
Arthur Baxter. And if Baxter would
forge one bill he would forge another. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
would know the signatures of both Lord
Deverell and Sir John.</p>

<p>But then—and the thought flashed across
Tempest’s brain—so would any of the
clerks in the office. They could get at the
key of the office. It was by no means unlikely
that one of them might have had
access to Baxter’s rooms. Picking up the
telephone, he at once rang up the Exchange
and asked to be put on the number which
he knew was that of the solicitor’s flat.</p>

<p>“That you Bailey?—I’m Mr. Tempest.
Have any of the clerks from the firm’s
offices ever been down to Mr. Baxter’s in
his absence?—Just ask your wife then.—Yes?—Which
of them—Smith, do you say?—When
did he come?—Can she fix the
day?—What excuse did he give?—Was he
allowed to go in?—Oh no, I don’t blame
her—of course she knew who Smith was.—Tell
her not to say anything.”</p>

<p>Tempest put down the receiver, and sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
at his table, puzzled and worried to distraction.
Should he have Smith arrested?
To all intents and purposes, the evidence
against Baxter and Smith was practically
the same. If the revolver was found in the
suit-case of the former, the latter had had
an opportunity of putting it there, and, to
all intents and purposes, was the only person
who, as far as he could see, had had
such an opportunity.</p>

<p>But he felt certain that no jury would
convict Smith, and release Baxter, on the
evidence as it stood. Smith had had a
perfect alibi at the inquest. He had been
at home all the evening. Both his father
and his brother had given evidence of it,
and other evidence was offered, as a party
had been taking place at their house that
night. Still, they had Smith’s admission
that, save Sir John, he was the last to leave,
and he might have shot Sir John before he
left. If Smith were guilty, he would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
to be convicted out of his own mouth, and
Tempest believed this would be easier to
do, when cross-examining him as a witness,
than if he were a prisoner. One
can go to greater lengths with a witness
than one can in cross-examining a prisoner.
Decency compels a prisoner to be given
fair play, and a judge would take good
care he had it. Picking up a pen, Tempest
wrote a note to the inspector:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Parkyns</span>,—I take it you will
have to call Smith (Sir John Rellingham’s
confidential clerk) as a witness when Mr.
Baxter is tried. I very particularly wish
to cross-examine him. I don’t want to
arouse his suspicions by doing it before the
magistrate, and I don’t want you to put him
on his guard by any obvious attentions.
But I wish you would pass the word along
that care must be taken that he doesn’t slip
through our fingers. I shouldn’t be surprised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
at this, if he thought it likely he
would be asked certain questions which I
intend to put to him. Could you also
make an opportunity of taking that bank
clerk to the firm’s offices, and let him see
Smith, on the chance of his recognising
him as Everard Clarke? If you’ll ask for
Mr. Marston, I’ll arrange with him that
Smith shall be called in on some excuse
whilst you are there.—Yours faithfully,
<span class="smcap">Ashley Tempest</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>A few days later came the reply:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—I did as you requested, but
Jenks (the bank clerk) evidently did <i>not</i>
recognise Smith. I also took Isaacson’s
clerk there the next day. He was certain
he had never seen Smith before. I will
have Smith watched, as you suggest.—Yours
respectfully, <span class="smcap">S. Parkyns</span>.</p>

<p>“<i>P. S.</i>—At Bow Street to-morrow we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
are calling evidence as to the state of Mr.
Baxter’s banking account. He had only a
very small balance—far less than one
would expect—but he had a balance. I
cannot find, however, that he was in debt,
and I hear he spends a lot of money in
buying pictures, etc.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Yardley,” said Parkyns the following
day, when the prisoner had been again remanded,
“do you think Mr. Tempest
knows young Deverell—the young brother
of the new Lord?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because there’s one line I’m puzzled
to think why your lot don’t try to follow
up.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that it’s any particular
business of mine to help you with the
defence, but it seems so obvious to me.
Young Deverell’s a rank bad lot. Oh, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
know he hasn’t lost caste, or anything of
that kind,” added the inspector, as Yardley
attempted to interrupt; “but all the same
he’s a bad lot. We’ve had a good many inquiries
about him at the Yard over one
thing and another, and I know he is hard
up. It may not mean anything, and
nothing has ever been brought home to
him, but he has been mixed up in several
fishy transactions that never came into
court. You see, Deverell would know who
his father’s solicitors were. I know myself
he has borrowed money from Isaacson’s.
Suppose he forged his father’s name to
that bill; and then suppose he got frightened
and told his father? The old man,
at any rate if it were the first time, might
very well try to hush it up according to
the evidence Isaacson gave, and there’s no
doubt whatever that young Deverell left
England between that time and his father’s
death. He wasn’t mentioned in Lord Deverell’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
will, at least not in the newspaper
note of it. I haven’t bothered to see the
will itself.”</p>

<p>“But that doesn’t account for the Rellingham
bill, Parkyns?”</p>

<p>“No, I quite admit that; and, of course,
Mr. Tempest may know a lot of other details
that upset what I’ve told you. But
just ask him if he knew young Deverell.”</p>

<p>Yardley passed on his conversation with
Parkyns to Tempest at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>“No,” the barrister at once said. “I
know nothing about Deverell. What you
tell me is most important;” and once again
Tempest’s wits were started in a new direction.
That such a person as young
Deverell existed he did know, but of his
character he was entirely ignorant. The
man belonged to a younger generation,
and the two had never happened to meet.</p>

<p>The hint of Parkyns opened up a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
position. Deverell might have forged the
one bill. Whoever did had had access
to or had copied the firm’s notepaper.
Having successfully discounted one bill it
was quite likely a second attempt might be
made; and Sir John Rellingham, likely
enough, would write personal letters to
Lord Deverell, from which his writing
and signature could be copied. But Tempest
could not think out that supposition
any further: nor could he fit it in any way
with the discovery of the revolver in Baxter’s
suit-case. Involuntarily his suspicions
harked back to Smith, and the barrister
turned his mind to the possibility of breaking
up the alibi which Smith put forward.
The alibi given at the coroner’s inquest
had certainly never been subjected to cross-examination.
Such was the point at which
matters stood when an entirely new development
occurred. Marston came round to
Tempest’s chambers, and, their greeting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
over, placed a gold watch and chain on the
table. “Tempest, this was Sir John’s,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Well, how can they help?” said the
barrister, picking them up.</p>

<p>“Open the back. I only saw that the
back opened yesterday. It’s a keyless
watch; and though I bought it at the sale
of Sir John’s things I never thought of
opening it till yesterday.” Tempest opened
the watch, and almost jumped from his seat
in his astonishment.</p>

<p>“Look there!” he almost shouted, as he
pointed to the miniature hanging on the
wall, and then held out, for the other man
to compare with it, the portrait inside the
case. The two faces were identical.</p>

<p>“Who is it, Tempest?”</p>

<p>“That miniature is Dolores Alvarez,
who died twenty years ago, and it’s the
living image of Evangeline Stableford,
who was murdered the other day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“Then, which of the two did Sir John
know? Whose portrait was he carrying?”</p>

<p>“You can soon settle that. If it be the
younger woman, then this miniature of Sir
John’s must have been painted within the
last three or four years. Otherwise it
could not be a full-grown woman, but
would be a picture of a young girl. If the
miniature was fitted in by the firm who
made the watch, then it’s the portrait of
Dolores. I’ve been confident all along—at
any rate of late—that the mystery of Sir
John’s death and the mystery of Evangeline
Stableford’s death was one and the same
mystery. This likeness between the three
can’t be pure coincidence. Marston, Yardley
will tell you that weeks ago I came to
the conclusion that Evangeline was Sir
John’s daughter, and this portrait in Sir
John’s watch is probably that of Evangeline’s
mother.”</p>

<p class="caption">“‘Look there!’ he almost shouted, as he pointed to the miniature”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“Then do you think that Evangeline was
the daughter of Dolores Alvarez?”</p>

<p>The barrister lighted a cigarette, and
dropped into his habit of pacing up and
down his room. At last Marston broke
the silence by repeating the question.</p>

<p>“Marston, everything points to that—if
there is anything in deductive reasoning
when applied to the solution of this kind
of problem—it would seem that that is the
certain fact. Over and over again I come
back to it. Argue it out, reason it out by
any chain of reasoning, by any sequence of
argument you like to adopt, you must come
back, as I always do, to that conclusion.
It seems as certain to me as the mathematical
answer to a problem in algebra. There
is no other conclusion. It’s the logical solution
of every argument, but it’s wrong
somewhere, for it doesn’t happen to be
right.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Why’s it wrong?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>“Simply because Dolores never had a
child. The doctors who made the post-mortem
are positive about that. It’s a
matter that can’t admit of any doubt. It’s
a fact that cannot be questioned. Dolores
never had a child. So our reasoning is at
fault, though I can’t see where.”</p>

<p>“Had she a sister?”</p>

<p>“Only Lady Madeley. Yardley has
made inquiries that settle that.”</p>

<p>“Then could Evangeline have been a
child of Lady Madeley—unacknowledged,
of course?”</p>

<p>“No, that can’t be true either.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Evangeline is left at Lady Stableford’s
House on a certain date—within ten days of
the date of the marriage of Lord and Lady
Madeley. The child that was left was less
than ten days old. That much the doctors
can swear to. I’ve seen the case book of
the man Lady Stableford called in. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
child must have been born within a margin
of two days on either side of the date of the
wedding. Lord Madeley dined with his
fiancée at the Langham Hotel the night
before the wedding. Obviously a woman
could not have been dining out within
twenty-four hours of having had a child.
The day before that she came to town from
Cornwall. After the wedding they went to
Paris. The child could not have been
born on the wedding day. The day after
they dined at the Embassy in Paris. The
next day they went on further south. No,
Lady Madeley could not have given birth
to a child at that time.</p>

<p>“Besides, Marston, the hundred years in
the secret trust was to run from 18th
August, 1881. That was the date of the
wedding day, and that was stated to be the
date of the birth of the child originally
offered to Lady Stableford, and in all
probability that was the child she did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
adopt. The secret trust was for the benefit
of Evangeline, of that I am certain. By
the way, I suppose your firm aren’t Lady
Stableford’s solicitors by any chance?”</p>

<p>“As it happens we are—or at any rate
were. We still have a lot of her papers.
She was one of Sir John’s old original
clients. Sir John acted for her when she
was negotiating for the adoption of that
child which you say is Evangeline.”</p>

<p>“Did you make her will?”</p>

<p>“Sir John did.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me that?”</p>

<p>“How was I to know there was any
connection?”</p>

<p>“What’s the date of Sir John’s will?”</p>

<p>“September, 1900.”</p>

<p>“When did Lady Stableford make her
will?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t tell you off-hand. I’ll send
you word.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll come round now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>Together the two men went to the offices
of Messrs. Rellingham, Baxter, Marston &amp; Moorhouse,
and Marston turned up the
letter-books. “Here you are, Tempest.
Lady Stableford must have written, because
here, you see, Sir John writes, suggesting
Lady Stableford should reconsider her suggestion,
and pointing out that going on the
stage is not necessarily an abandonment of
all morality. Then here’s the next letter in
which he sends the will for execution, and
again refers to the injustice of leaving the
girl penniless, after having brought her up
to regard herself as heir. That’s the end
of July, 1900.”</p>

<p>“And then Sir John, evidently knowing
that Evangeline was cut off with a shilling,
I suppose by Lady Stableford, a month or
more later creates this secret trust. The
thing is self-evident.”</p>

<p>“That may be so, Tempest; but some six
months before Sir John died, Lady Stableford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
and Evangeline were reconciled, and
the old lady made another will, by which
the girl would have got nearly everything.
I remember that will, for I drafted it.
Now, Sir John never altered his will or
cancelled the secret trust which then became
unnecessary, if your theory were
right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that doesn’t matter. He very
likely thought it quite probable Lady
Stableford might possibly change her mind
again.”</p>

<p>“Well, granted it’s all as you say—granted
Evangeline was Sir John’s daughter,
what’s it all come to?”</p>

<p>“Nothing as yet, Marston; but who was
the girl’s mother? Who was or is Lady
Rellingham?”</p>

<p>“Did he marry the mother?”</p>

<p>“Quite likely. Let’s look it up. It
must be before August, 1881. Come along
down to Somerset House.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>Together the two men made the search,
and found that early in 1880 John Rellingham,
solicitor, had married Sarah Jane
Manuel, daughter of Pedro Manuel of
Dublin, hairdresser. His second marriage
to Georgiana Drury, as they knew, had not
taken place until 1890.</p>

<p>“That’s put the stopper on any Alvarez
business, Tempest, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“It looks like it certainly.”</p>

<p>Tempest paid for another search ticket,
and turned up the marriage of Lord Madeley.
Lady Madeley had been married in
the name of Eulalie Alvarez.</p>

<p>“I think we must put Yardley on to an
investigation of Pedro Manuel and his
family. That is obviously the thing to do.”
“What earthly chance is there of his
finding out anything?”</p>

<p>“Precious little, I’m afraid,” said the
barrister. “But there’s one thing we might
do, Marston. Bring that trust into court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
again, and paragraph it as an approaching
case, and see if we can tempt the lady to
turn up again.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if she would?”</p>

<p>“She might do; for, of course, she can’t
have the slightest suspicion that we have
guessed she has some connection with the
case.”</p>

<p>“How will you bring it on, Tempest?
There isn’t much time.”</p>

<p>“Give notice of a motion for Friday next,
and put up somebody, and I’ll have enough
of a wrangle with him in court to get it into
the papers, and then we’ll ask his lordship
to adjourn it for a week, on the chance of a
mutual settlement. It must be well reported,
and I daresay that can be arranged.
Very likely the lady will turn up on the
following Friday.”</p>

<p>“But can you get the trial of Baxter postponed
till afterwards?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ll put up some sort of defence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
and address the magistrate at great length,
and then get another remand. That will
throw us over the coming sessions of the
Central Criminal Court. There aren’t any
sessions in August, so we will have over
five weeks. We ought to know where we
stand then.”</p>

<p>In due course affidavits were lodged;
and Tempest moved on behalf of Marston,
for an appointment of a receiver of the
trust funds pending the decision of the
court on an issue shortly to be raised as to
a division of the trust funds between the
surviving partners of the late Sir John
Rellingham. Other counsel had been
briefed for Baxter and for Moorhouse,
and for three-quarters of an hour the three
men wrangled before the judge. Hints of
sensational disclosures, veiled comment, and
flat contradiction, all did their work.</p>

<p>“Mr. Tempest,” said the judge, “I’m
very much in the dark. Cannot you indicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
in some way the nature of this trust?
I’m not suggesting you should disclose anything
obviously intended to be kept secret;
but why was the trust created? Was it to
benefit a person or persons, or was it to
carry out a purpose? Obviously, under
the terms of the will, and by the decree of
this court, the money now belongs to the
surviving partners of the firm. Why not
divide it? Does a purpose still exist to
which the partners desire to apply it?”</p>

<p>“Strange as it may appear, my lord, I
can only ask your lordship to accept my
word that the partners have not and have
never had the remotest idea of what
object was in the mind of Sir John Rellingham
when he created the trust.”</p>

<p>“Surely that cannot be so. The will
says, ‘to be applied by them to and for the
purposes which I have sufficiently indicated
to them.’ You see Sir John says he
has indicated. It’s the past tense.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“Quite so, my lord. The instructions
were in a sealed packet. This packet was
not to be opened until certain eventualities
occurred; and there were certain stringent
instructions left with it that the moment
litigation began the packet was to be destroyed.
Your lordship will remember the
Crown did begin litigation, and consequently
the papers were destroyed. It
seems to me, my lord, that Sir John’s first
idea, overriding everything else, was to
preserve the secrecy he enjoined upon the
trustees he appointed; and rather than that
that secrecy should be waived, he preferred
that the object of the trust should
suffer and his partners benefit. His partners
have loyally adhered to his wishes, and
the money is theirs. They claim it, and
they repudiate any claim to it by anybody
else; but, nevertheless, they feel that the
past action of the Crown could not have
been anticipated by Sir John, and they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
disinclined at present to dissipate what
were originally trust funds. There has
been no quarrel, but at the same time they
differ amongst themselves as to the course
which should now be pursued. May I put
it that they are in a friendly state of doubt
and uncertainty?”</p>

<p>The discussion went on; and finally, at
the end of an hour, Tempest threw out a
suggestion that perhaps, if his lordship
would adjourn the case for a week, it might
be possible to agree to terms which could
then be submitted for the approval of the
court. The judge at once consented; and
in view of the newspaper interest which
had previously been excited on the subject
of this secret trust, all of the evening papers
and most of the morning ones the next day
reported the proceedings with some detail.</p>

<p>Nothing remained to do but to wait patiently
for the week which must ensue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
before they could know whether or not the
bait had been effective.</p>

<p>On the following Friday morning Tempest
was early in his seat in Chancery
Court No. 3. The benches were always
packed on a motion day, and Tempest had
no desire to take part in the jostling scrimmage
for seats, which was usual on such
occasions.</p>

<p>A belated K. C. struggled through the
crowd in the doorway, his gown half torn
from his back in the crush. Seeing Tempest,
he turned and said:</p>

<p>“Look here, old man, why can’t you
keep your beastly sensational cases out of
our way here? Just look at this menagerie
of a place instead of the usual staid and
sober appearance of a chancery court? It’s
demoralising!”</p>

<p>Tempest laughed. “For pity’s sake,
don’t blame me. I didn’t bring ’em.”</p>

<p>“No, but your case has.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“Well, they’ll be awfully disappointed.
It’s all arranged between us now.”</p>

<p>“Silence!” called out the usher, and
their conversation ended, as everybody rose,
and returned the bow of Mr. Justice
Barker.</p>

<p>“Mr. So-and-So,” and the judge called
on the leader in his court. Tempest
turned in his seat and eagerly scanned the
faces of those present in court and in the
gallery. At last, right at the back of the
court, he caught sight of the person for
whom he was looking. Dressed in black,
and heavily veiled, he saw the same woman
who had excited his curiosity on a previous
occasion. He looked at Yardley wedged
in the crowd near the doorway, and caught
the detective’s half-veiled nod which
showed that he had also found his quarry.
Next to Yardley was standing Craven, his
assistant, a perfect sleuthhound of a
tracker; and before Tempest’s gaze had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
dropped again to his papers, he had seen
Craven leave the court, to reappear in a
moment at the other door, within a yard or
two of the woman they wanted.</p>

<p>One by one the King’s Council present
in court were called upon; and then, after
one or two of the junior bar—habitués of
that particular court—had each been given
his opportunity by name, came the concluding,
“Any more motions behind the
bar?” and Tempest rose, and in a few
words said that the parties concerned had
agreed to ask his lordship to appoint them
jointly to be receivers, pending the trial of
the issue. The judge promptly assented to
the proposal, and then at once the court
began to empty of the public, baulked of
the anticipated revelation; but Tempest
lingered, curious to see what might happen.
A tedious dispute as to a right-of-way injunction
followed, but the lady sat on, apparently
keenly interested. Concluding it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
to be a ruse to mask any apparent concern
with the matter just concluded, and knowing
she would be safe in the care of Yardley
and Craven, Tempest signed to his
clerk to collect his papers, and took his way
to the King’s Bench side, where another
case awaited him. Marston followed him
into the passage.</p>

<p>“Well, it unearthed the lady,” said the
barrister.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I saw Yardley was there.”</p>

<p>“So was Craven, his chief assistant. By
the way, what instructions did you give
him, Marston?”</p>

<p>“He is to find out who she is and where
she lives. I wish she had raised her veil
in court. I’d have liked to have seen
her.”</p>

<p>“So should I; but I never for a moment
expected that. She’ll be much too downy
a bird. How old would you guess her to
be, Marston?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>“Forty to fifty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what I put her down to be;
but one really cannot tell under that veil
of hers. It’s only guessing from her figure
and manner. She might really be anything
from thirty to seventy.”</p>

<p>Late that evening Yardley came round
to Tempest’s chambers.</p>

<p>“Well, who is she, Yardley?” was the
latter’s greeting.</p>

<p>“She’s staying at the Hotel Victoria, in
the name of Mrs. Seymour. I’ve left Craven
there, and he’s subsidised one of the
chambermaids as well, so I don’t think
she’ll slip through our fingers.”</p>

<p>“Where does she come from?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know for certain yet. She’s
registered as from Paris. I’ve arranged
that one of my young women shall go to the
hotel as a chambermaid to-morrow, on the
chance of an opportunity of going through
the lady’s belongings.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>Three days later Yardley again came
round to see Tempest, but only to report an
ignominious failure. It was evident that
Mrs. Seymour had become aware that she
was being watched and had made her plans
accordingly.</p>

<p>Asking for a hansom to be called one
morning, she had ostentatiously given instructions
to the hall porter that she was
expecting a visitor at noon, and, if she herself
had not returned, the visitor was to be
asked to wait. She then gave the cabby
directions to go to Paquin’s showrooms in
Doder Street, and had driven away. Craven
had been inclined to follow; but feeling
certain Mrs. Seymour would return, he
decided that more was to be gained by
overhauling her boxes, and he at once
sought his confederate, who was figuring
in the hotel as a chambermaid. Together
they had thoroughly and systematically
searched Mrs. Seymour’s room. Not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
scrap of writing did they find—not the
faintest clue of any sort from which they
could start to establish the identity of Mrs.
Seymour. Finally, they had relinquished
the search in disgust, and Craven had set
himself to await the lady’s return. She
never did return; and when Craven reported,
Yardley saw at once that the whole
thing had been a ruse. The cabby, when
found and questioned, told them that when
they reached Trafalgar Square, his fare
had told him to drive to Euston. He had
done so, and the lady had entered the station.
The most diligent inquiry failed to
produce any person who had seen and recognised
or had noticed the lady at the station.
None of the booking-clerks recognised
her from the description which was
given. Her luggage, which remained at
the hotel unclaimed, contained nothing of
any sufficient value for it to be in the least
likely it would ever be claimed, if Yardley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
were correct in his surmise that Mrs. Seymour
had by some means become aware
that she herself was under surveillance, and
had deliberately elected to withdraw herself
from observation.</p>

<p>The court for Crown cases reserved having
decided—much to the disgust of the
police—that the privilege of a solicitor
prevented the execution of the search warrant
and the overhauling of the papers of
the firm, the trial of Arthur Baxter could
no longer be delayed, and took its place in
the judge’s list at the ensuing sessions of the
Central Criminal Court. At the first reference
by the prosecution to the secret trust,
Tempest successfully objected. As he
pointed out, Baxter had only been advantaged
by the action of the Crown, which
had, with full knowledge of the consequence,
itself precipitated the circumstances,
which vested the money in the hands
of the surviving partners. That result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
Baxter could neither have produced nor
anticipated; but for the moment assuming
he could have produced it, then the three
partners were equally concerned, and must
be equally guilty; but the Crown had only
indicated one, though, on an indictment
of the three for conspiracy, a conviction
would have been more easy to procure.
Finally, he said that if his lordship admitted
any reference to the secret trust on the
ground of motive, then he should at once
call the other surviving partners to prove
that no one of the three had ever even suggested
the division of the trust money, even
after the court had formally declared it to
be the absolute property of the partners;
but that they had voluntarily reconstituted
the trust, or rather had themselves constituted
a trust for purposes which they declined
to divulge, but which advantaged
themselves personally no more than had
the original will. In the end the judge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
upheld the objection. The trial was thus
narrowed down to the fact that the partners
possessed keys, and could have obtained access;
that Baxter had been overheard to
have had a difference with Sir John, when
the latter had called at his chambers the
night preceding the murder; and, what
was most damning, that a revolver, with
its marks of identification erased, together
with bullets similar to the one which had
caused the death of Sir John Rellingham,
had been found at Mr. Baxter’s chambers
secreted in a seldom used suit-case.</p>

<p>The case at best was a weak one; and
doubtless relying upon the fact that Arthur
Baxter would go into the witness-box and
might convict himself under cross-examination,
the ruling out of the question of the
secret trust seriously handicapped the prosecution.
Tempest had frankly told Baxter
he didn’t believe the explanation of the
quarrel which the solicitor had vouchsafed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
him, but Baxter declined to give any other.
For that reason the barrister was surprised
that only one or two formal questions relating
to the quarrel were put to Bailey, the
factotum of Arthur Baxter, and one of the
witnesses called for the prosecution. Consequently
Tempest asked Baxter no questions
on the point when he put him in the
witness-box. But the matter was raised and
pressed in his cross-examination. Question
after question he cleverly fenced with;
but at last, driven into a corner, he gave a
full explanation: “I have tried to keep
faith with Sir John,” he said; “but you
won’t let me. The point was simply this:
Sir John called at my chambers, and asked
me if I would marry his daughter.
Neither I nor my partners at that time had
the smallest idea that Sir John had ever
been married except to his late wife, whom
we all knew, or had ever had a daughter;
and when I was talking to him, I didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
know whether his daughter were illegitimate
or legitimate. He showed me her
portrait. She was a very beautiful girl;
but all I felt inclined to promise was that
I was quite willing to meet her, with the
idea of marriage, if we mutually liked
each other, and providing all knowledge
was kept from her until after marriage that
she had been the subject of discussion and
arrangement between us. I wanted to win
the affection of the girl on my own merits,
or else I would be no party to such a marriage.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Baxter,” had been counsel’s
reply, “you say Sir John was asking a favour
of you, or requesting you to fall in
with a proposal of his? How do you account
for the fact that it was Sir John who
said, ‘No, Arthur; don’t say any more.
It’s quite final. I will not’? You admit,
I suppose, that he did say that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he said it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“Well, then, how do you reconcile that
with your story?”</p>

<p>“I asked him if he would acknowledge
the girl openly as his daughter. He
wouldn’t. I tried to persuade him, and
then he answered in the words you put to
me.”</p>

<p>Then came a searching cross-examination
about the two bills. Baxter explained
the second one by saying he was acting for
the late Lord Deverell. The other bill,
which had reached the money-lenders who
had discounted it, with a request written
in the name of the firm, Baxter absolutely
repudiated any knowledge of. He likewise
disclaimed the slightest knowledge of
the revolver or the bullets, and emphatically
denied having himself hidden them in
the suit-case.</p>

<p>Tempest then called clerks in the office
of the firm to prove that the letter to the
money-lenders was not in the handwriting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
of Mr. Baxter or of any of the firm’s clerks,
and then played his trump card. Calling
an expert, he proved that the revolver was
of faulty construction, and that it had
never been fired, and that it would have
been quite impossible for the bullet which
killed Sir John Rellingham to have been
fired from it.</p>

<p>“What would happen if the attempt had
been made?”</p>

<p>“It would have burst.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because the barrel of the revolver is
imperfectly bored, and at one point the
bullet could not have passed through.”</p>

<p>The revolver, a bullet, and a ramrod
were then passed to the jury, to satisfy
themselves on the point.</p>

<p>With this disclosure the case for the prosecution
practically collapsed; and though
it pursued its formal course, to its completion,
there remained no further doubt that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
the verdict would be one of acquittal, as
eventually it proved to be. Arthur Baxter
left the court a free man, honourably
acquitted.</p>

<p>When the partners and Tempest were
discussing the trial that evening over the
dinner which Marston gave to celebrate
the result of the trial, Tempest turned to
Baxter and asked:</p>

<p>“Why on earth wouldn’t you tell me before
what that discussion was that you had
with Sir John?”</p>

<p>“Simply because he said the disclosure
would be the disclosure of a secret, not of
his own, but of somebody else whom he
couldn’t give away.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Then I guessed right?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>And then Tempest explained how he
had argued himself into the conclusion that
the secret trust had been constituted to provide
for Sir John’s daughter, and arranged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
in its curious form that the secret of a third
party might be safeguarded.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me all that, Tempest?”</p>

<p>“I told Marston, but I didn’t see at the
time how it affected you. Did Sir John
tell you who his daughter was, or what the
name was that she was known by?”</p>

<p>“No, he wouldn’t tell me even that, unless
I would promise blindly to marry her.
As I said in court, I only promised conditionally,
and Sir John said that he must refuse
to tell me her name.”</p>

<p>“Marston, show him Sir John’s watch.”</p>

<p>The solicitor took the watch from his
chain and passed it across the table to his
partner.</p>

<p>“That’s the girl whose portrait he
showed me, though the face is in a different
position.”</p>

<p>“No, Baxter, it isn’t the same girl. The
portrait in the watch is an exact duplicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
of a miniature I have hanging in my chambers.
Twenty years ago I had a watching
brief at the inquest of Dolores Alvarez, an
actress——”</p>

<p>“I remember the case. Verdict of suicide,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that was it. It was my first cause
célèbre. I saw the dead woman, and was
very much struck by her beauty. I collected
all the photographs I could purchase
of her, and I had a miniature painted
from them. It was not exactly like any of
the photographs, and I was puzzled how
Sir John could have got hold of what was
undoubtedly a copy of my miniature till I
made inquiries. Then I found that the
firm—a big firm of photographers, whom
I had commissioned—had been so struck
by the miniature that they had ordered a
copy of it from the artist, and they had exhibited
this copy as a specimen. Sir John
had seen it and bought it. Consequently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
Baxter, the portrait in Sir John’s watch
was to him a fancy portrait, which I assume
he must have bought on account of
its likeness to his wife—oh, yes, he was
married twice. We got the certificate of
his first marriage all right—for a man
would hardly carry about inside his watch
a definite portrait of a person in whom he
had no interest. Besides, Baxter, I can
probably tell you who Sir John’s daughter
was. She was Evangeline Stableford—the
actress—the adopted daughter of old Lady
Stableford. She was the living image of
Dolores Alvarez, and she was murdered a
few months ago—since the death of Sir
John, in fact. The curious thing is, that
every detail and every circumstance of her
death exactly reproduces the death of Dolores
Alvarez twenty years ago.”</p>

<p>“Were the two women related, Tempest?”</p>

<p>“The likeness is so remarkable that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
think they must have been; but, as a matter
of actual fact, I cannot prove it. Evangeline
was certainly not the daughter of Dolores.
The only relative I have unearthed
of Dolores is Lady Madeley; and from the
date of Lady Madeley’s wedding and the
date of Evangeline’s birth, she could not
have been the child of Lady Madeley. Besides,
Sir John didn’t marry a Miss Alvarez.
The maiden name of Lady Rellingham,
for I daresay she is still alive, or Sir
John wouldn’t have guarded her secret so
closely, was Sarah Jane Manuel.”</p>

<p>“But Alvarez may have been only a theatrical
name?”</p>

<p>“That’s quite possible—likely even;
only, Lady Madeley is married in the name
of Alvarez. There’s such a widespread
idea, particularly in the lower classes, that
a marriage in a false name is invalid, that
I hardly think it probable that Lady Madeley
would have risked the validity of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
marriage by going through the ceremony
in any other than her real name. She may
have done so, of course; but the probabilities
are vastly to the contrary. Frankly,
Baxter, the idea of relationship rests exclusively
upon the likeness.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that must be so; besides, assume
Dolores and Evangeline were related.
What’s the nearest possible relationship?
You say they can’t be mother and daughter.
The next nearest relationship is aunt
and niece, on the supposition that Lady
Rellingham is an undiscovered sister of
Lady Madeley and Dolores Alvarez. You
must take into account that it is not an identity
of parentage. Evangeline is only a
daughter of a supposed sister and Sir John.
You must make allowance for her descent
from Sir John as well.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think you need do that.
Given a parent of a pronounced type—what
one would call an aggressive type—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
type will be reproduced and the type of the
other parent submerged altogether. Probably
Evangeline exactly reproduced her
mother. She had nothing of Sir John in
her appearance. Here I’ll show you what
I mean. Waiter!”</p>

<p>The obsequious servant hurried forward.</p>

<p>“Send out and buy me a copy of this
week’s <i>Sketch</i>, will you?” and Tempest
handed a coin to the man.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the latter reappeared
with the paper for which the barrister
had asked. He rapidly turned the
pages. “Now this,” he said, “is what I
mean. Here is a portrait of the young
Lady Madeley—Consuelo, Baroness Madeley
in her own right, the daughter of Eulalie
Alvarez.”</p>

<p>Folding the paper he indicated the portrait
to which he referred. “You see,” he
added, “that’s awfully like Dolores.
There’s the same type again, submerging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
any likelihood of a likeness to the other
parent, for old Lord Madeley was fair and
fat and podgy—blue eyes, as a matter of
fact. Sir John was fair, and his features
were very indefinite. Evangeline’s mother
and Lady Madeley, even if there were no
relationship, were of the same physiological
type, and that an aggressive one, and
you see the type reproduces itself. I’m almost
beginning to think it must be merely
type and domination of type, and that
alone, with no question of consanguinity.
Besides, when all’s said and done, it’s a foreign
type.”</p>

<p>“But what does that matter?”</p>

<p>“What I mean is this: Just as all niggers
look alike to an Englishman, and just
as we find it hard to distinguish one Chinaman
from another, so a strange type to us
overrides in our observations the little differences
by which in our own type we distinguish
one another and recognise each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
other. Therefore, may not this type—Spanish,
I suppose it must be, from the
name Alvarez—override, in our observation
(from the fact that it is foreign and
unusual), the little niceties of difference
by which those who belonged to the type
would themselves differentiate?”</p>

<p>“Then, do you mean that these people
may not really be so alike as we think they
are?”</p>

<p>“That’s precisely what I do mean.
Here we have apparently Eulalie Lady
Madeley, and Dolores Alvarez, and Consuelo
Lady Madeley, whom we know to be
related, all very much alike. We have
Lady Rellingham and another girl, Evangeline
Stableford, and yet another, Sir
John’s daughter, if they are not one and
the same, though I am sure they are. We
are trying to presume an Alvarez relationship
for Evangeline, solely on account of
her remarkable likeness and the presumed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
likeness of Lady Rellingham. There is
not one other single solitary reason from
which relationship can be presumed; and
after all, to a person familiar with the type,
the likeness might not be so pronounced as
to us it appears to be. To a Spaniard, for
instance, it might not be sufficient to even
suggest relationship. You’ve always got
to bear that in mind. So long as the identity
of Evangeline was a mystery, we had
to clutch at any straw that might prove
who she was, and perhaps I attached too
great an importance to the likeness. It is
nothing like so important now we are practically
certain Evangeline was Sir John’s
daughter and that we know who her
mother was. Besides, Lady Rellingham’s
name was Manuel. That name is Spanish
or Portuguese, and very likely Jewish as
well, which accounts for the occurrence of
the type, and, as I said, the likeness may
be no more than identity of type.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“Tempest,” said Marston, “I’m beginning
to understand your wonderful success
with juries. We argued this likeness point
once before, when you were putting forward
a very different theory. I thoroughly
accepted what you said then, but
you have convinced me just as thoroughly
of your new proposition.”</p>

<p>The barrister laughed. “I’ll tell you
the secret of that. There are weak points
in both propositions, because there is in
each an unknown quantity, and one argues
on the ‘may’ and the ‘might’ and the
‘probable.’ One can always persuade a
reasonable man that a thing ‘may’ be so, if
the proposition you offer is plausible and
not self-negatived. But when you lay
down a proposition as not only possible but
unquestionably correct, and one goes on to
the words ‘is’ and ‘must be’ and ‘therefore,’
one needs to prove things. However,
what are we going to do to-night?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
What do you say, Baxter? How about the
Palace?”</p>

<p>Baxter shivered. “Don’t let me stop
you others, if you want to go; but I don’t
feel up to it. God! It’s only a few hours
since the noose was around my neck, and I
haven’t got over the horror of it yet.”</p>

<p>The others looked at him with sympathy.
They had been ready enough to forget
what was over and done with.</p>

<p>“But I told you yesterday, Baxter, that
I would get you off. Didn’t you believe I
could?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t you I doubted, Tempest; it
was the jury. One does get such damned
fools sometimes as jurymen, and there’s an
awful lot of prejudice against us. That
newspaper campaign was carried to ghastly
lengths. Tempest, have you got any
nearer in your own way to solving the
mystery of either Sir John’s death or Evangeline’s
death?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>“No, not an inch nearer; except that I’m
pretty certain Evangeline was Sir John’s
daughter. At present it’s arguing with
several unknown quantities. Still, one
has got a bit of a foundation now. Sir
John has been proved to have married a
certain Sarah Jane Manuel.”</p>

<p>“Then Sarah Jane Manuel was Evangeline’s
mother, Q. E. D.? Go along, Tempest!”</p>

<p>“How do you know, Marston? I don’t
feel by any means certain on the point.
Look here, then, why didn’t Sir John acknowledge
his wife and daughter? He
told you, Baxter, that he couldn’t because
that would involve the disclosure of somebody
else’s secret. If she were his daughter
by his wedded wife, what secret could
there be about her birth? I can assure
you that it looks very much as if Evangeline
were his illegitimate daughter. Only,
if she were, what earthly object could anyone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
have in murdering her? Sir John had
left her nothing in his will. She was not
his heir. She stood in no one’s way.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t Sir John provide for her,
Tempest? He was a just, honourable
man, with plenty of money. He leaves the
whole of his money practically to us—the
three of us; and none of us had any claim
on him. As a matter of fact, it was the
contrary. We were all indebted to Sir
John.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve forgotten the probability is
that Sir John did provide for her by means
of the secret trust. Evangeline was expected
to be the heir of Lady Stableford.
Here, of course, it won’t go any further.
You fellows have got the old lady’s will at
your office. Now, did she provide for the
girl?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Sir John drew her will, so he
knew what she had done.”</p>

<p>“Quite so; and if she did provide, Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
John was under no necessity to disclose the
other person’s secret, which he was guarding,
by providing for the girl in his own
will. But Evangeline had quarrelled once
with Lady Stableford, and had been cut
out of the will once before. There was always
the risk of another quarrel and the
same thing happening again. That was
the risk for which the secret trust provides—of
that I’m positive now. Yes, I think
we can take that as certain;” and the barrister,
lighting another of his eternal cigarettes,
tilted his chair back and lapsed into
silence as he thought.</p>

<p>The other men kept silent. Tempest
was so obviously puzzling the thing out
further. At last Marston broke the silence.
“Granted all that, Tempest. But
what on earth was the good to Evangeline
of creating that trust at all, if we, the trustees,
don’t know when we are to call it into
operation for her benefit?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“Don’t you forget your instructions. You
were to wait till something happened from
outside, to put you all in motion. You
must assume Sir John had laid his plans
for this something to be made to happen, if
necessary. As he would then be dead, the
making of the happening rested with some
third person, probably Evangeline herself.
Have you fellows forgotten the basis of a
cryptogram? The key is divided into two
parts, and those two parts must come together
in unison before the key is apparent.
You three have one part of the cryptogram
in your hands contained in your instructions.
It was probable Evangeline had
the other part. She was probably to write
to you, if through a change of Lady Stableford’s
will she needed the money. She is
dead. She will never claim the money,
and you three can spend it now with a light
heart. Still, here’s another thing. If
Evangeline knew all, and could call that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
trust into operation merely by writing to
you, what was to prevent her doing so,
whether she needed the money or not?
If Sir John left things in that state, the secret
was at the mercy of Evangeline, and
I don’t think it was her secret. She may
not have known what the secret was, nor
indeed that there was one at all, but nevertheless
its disclosure rested with her.
There was probably a third part to the
cryptogram in the hands of someone else.”</p>

<p>“Who would that be likely to be?”</p>

<p>“Probably the person whose secret it
was?”</p>

<p>“But if that were so, what would the inducement
be to her to ever disclose her secret?”</p>

<p>“One or other of two things. Either
she is to participate in the trust, or else Sir
John depended on the affection of a mother
to efface herself for her child in case of
dire necessity. Remember, it’s only a disclosure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
to you three, and that’s not a very
serious risk. Few people need mind that.”</p>

<p>“Then, why didn’t Sir John disclose it
to us?”</p>

<p>“Firstly, his loyalty regarding the secret
of another person; secondly, the risk run
by putting it on paper, when very likely,
in all probability, he would outlive Lady
Stableford, and himself know whether or
not Evangeline had been provided for; because,
if in his lifetime he knew Lady Stableford
had left her money to Evangeline,
the trust was quite unnecessary, and Sir
John would at once have destroyed his
present will and made another. Now, assuming
all that to be true, who stood to
benefit by Evangeline’s death?”</p>

<p>“We three did.”</p>

<p>“Quite so. Consequently it was jolly
lucky for Baxter the terms of the trust are
not public.”</p>

<p>“God! Tempest. What a risk I ran!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>“You did at first, old man. But there
was somebody else who would benefit. If
Evangeline were illegitimate, the person
whose secret was at stake might desire her
death. If Evangeline were legitimate, her
heir would benefit. In either case it is the
mother. Now, didn’t I tell you once before—argued
from a totally different
standpoint—that Evangeline’s mother had
murdered her?”</p>

<p>“But it’s such a horrible thought, Tempest,
that a mother would murder her own
child!”</p>

<p>“I know it is; but horrible or not, Marston,
it’s a thing done every day. Scarcely
a session at the Old Bailey goes by that
some poor wretched girl or other isn’t taking
her trial for it. We generally get them
let off as Not Guilty, or else only guilty of
concealment of birth, and then they are
usually discharged. But it’s generally
murder all the same. We all know it—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
police know it—and the judge knows it;
but there is a kind of unwritten code that
in cases of infanticide the girl is to get off,
if the facts can in any way be sufficiently
twisted.”</p>

<p>“But Evangeline wasn’t an infant.”</p>

<p>“No; but you were objecting only on the
score of maternal feeling. With an infant,
the maternal feeling is often overcome;
and as Evangeline’s mother got rid of her
as an infant, the maternal feeling can’t
have been any greater. It never had any
opportunity of growing.”</p>

<p>“Then you think, Tempest, that if we
find Evangeline’s mother, that we shall
have got to the solution of the girl’s murder?”</p>

<p>“You’ll have got the guilty person; but
assuming you do get hold of her, I don’t
see how you will ever convict her or get a
full solution, except by means of a confession.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>“Tempest, how about the murder of Sir
John? That is what we are most concerned
about.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know; and it puzzles me far
more than the other one. Outside you
three, what earthly object could anyone
have had in murdering him? Any client
with a grievance has got to murder all the
lot of you, either to wreak a revenge for a
business grievance to alter the course of any
events.”</p>

<p>“But, Tempest, we haven’t got such a
client. We scarcely ever litigate in the
ordinary sense. Chancery motions, by
mutual arrangement to get orders of the
court, and that kind of thing, don’t beget
clients or opponents with a grievance. Our
business is conveyancing and trust work
and family settlements. In the whole history
of the firm, we’ve never quarrelled
with a client over his or her account.”</p>

<p>“Then you are arguing yourselves a bit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
closer. I’m certain of this much. Sir
John had an appointment at the office that
evening with someone over a matter which
was not the business of the firm. If
Smith’s tale be true, Smith was practically
made to clear out. Therefore, Sir John
himself answers the door and admits somebody.
That somebody shoots him, and lets
himself or herself out afterwards, taking
the revolver with him. As far as I can see,
that is all you are justified as taking to be
provable by deduction, and you must start
guessing. Now, what was the only thing
we are any of us aware of that Sir John was
keeping secret?”</p>

<p>“His secret trust.”</p>

<p>“Well, put it rather the secret of this
other person to safeguard, which Sir John
created, the secret trust?”</p>

<p>“What next?”</p>

<p>“Who were the people who knew the
secret?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>“Sir John.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and also the person it concerned,
and perhaps Evangeline Stableford, too,
though I rather doubt if she knew the
whole or indeed very much of it. Now, as
I’ve told you, I believe it to be Evangeline’s
mother whose secret is being safeguarded.”</p>

<p>“Then do you say it was Evangeline’s
mother who murdered Sir John?”</p>

<p>“Oh, wait a bit! What was to prevent
Sir John having arranged a meeting between
the two of them there in his presence,
to make arrangements about calling
the trust into operation, if it were ever necessary?
Let’s assume he did. Assume
they met there, which of them would be the
more likely to shoot him?”</p>

<p>“The daughter,” said Marston.</p>

<p>“Why do you think that?”</p>

<p>“She murdered him and then committed
suicide.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>Tempest shook his head. “No, I think
you are wrong. The mother shot Sir John
in the presence of her daughter; then she
murders the daughter as well, to cover up
the disclosure. <i>Voila tout.</i> There you
have a complete explanation—a logical explanation,
and a sufficient one for both
murders.”</p>

<p>“Tempest, I believe you’ve hit it.”</p>

<p>“I may have done; but it’s all pure guesswork.
It won’t hang her.”</p>

<p>“How did she put the revolver in my
suit-case?”</p>

<p>“God knows, old man! That I fancy
will always be a mystery. When was the
revolver put there?”</p>

<p>“I wish I knew.”</p>

<p>“If the woman had thought, as she probably
did, she would know that you, with a
man servant, would never pack for yourself.
She couldn’t know which bag you
used, nor could she know when you would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
use any particular one. If she put that
revolver there any long time afterwards,
she must have guessed that the veriest fool
would know that Bailey might have packed
and unpacked in the interval, and could
swear to the absence of the revolver on the
days he packed and unpacked for you. No,
she probably put it there soon after the
murder—probably when Bailey’s wife was
away. That was soon after the murder
was committed. It’s quite likely you were
watched.”</p>

<p>“But why should she pitch upon me?”</p>

<p>“Because the first person suspected of an
unexplained murder is a person who would
stand to profit by the death. Don’t forget
she knew the broad outlines of the secret
trust—probably was the only person to
know them—and knew you three would
benefit greatly. Any one of you three would
satisfy her purpose. She simply followed
the line of least resistance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“But you are making her out, and assuming
her to be, as clever as yourself in thinking
things out. It’s a wrong presumption,
Tempest. I think I’d pass for a man of
average intelligence any day, but I should
never have thought of half the things
you’ve laid down.”</p>

<p>“No! no! Baxter. You may be a wee
bit surprised at my thinking them out—you
may, even as you say, have failed to do it
yourself, but the surprise to you rests on the
arrival at the conclusion from apparently
unknown premises. You must remember
there was nothing unknown to her, whilst
we are groping in the dark. She was in
the full light of a complete knowledge of
all the facts. I wish I knew whether the
woman were Sir John’s wife, or the mother
of Evangeline, or a third person altogether.
She may be both wife and mother. What
I advise you to do now is to search again
for the birth of Evangeline under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
names of Manuel and Rellingham. Search
in England, Scotland, and Ireland, and
France and Belgium and Holland. There’s
hardly time enough for her to have been
born further afield.”</p>

<p>“Is that all we can do?”</p>

<p>“Well, one step at a time isn’t a bad
plan. But as it happens there is something
else you can do. Look here! Assume that
I am right, and that the interview with
one or both of the women took place in
reference to the trust. It’s a big assumption
of course; but take it for granted for
the moment. Why did Sir John provoke or
permit that interview? Lady Stableford
had altered her will, cutting out Evangeline
nearly two years before; yet Sir John
took no steps. His will was certainly in
existence some time before his death; but,
as I explained to you, one, if not two,
other people had to be let into their
share of the cryptogram. If they knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
before, we can hardly presume the meeting
to have a reference to this point. On the
other hand, why have the meeting at all,
when Evangeline would come of age so
soon after? The moment she came of age
Sir John could have given her the money
without any other explanation than that he
was her father. He needn’t even have told
her that much. Any tale would have done,
and he had plenty of money to provide for
her in cash, and might just as well have
done so, instead of putting the money in
the trust. Why didn’t he wait a few
months longer? He had already waited
twenty years. He wasn’t an old man—only
fifty-five. Why should he have anticipated
his own death?”</p>

<p>“Goodness only knows! But go on. I
can see you’ve got some idea. Out with
it.”</p>

<p>“Who was Sir John’s doctor?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>“Old Allingham of Harley Street.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know the gentleman; but go to
him, and ask him whether, at any time
shortly before his death, Sir John consulted
him? I expect you will find Allingham
told him his heart was affected. If he did,
then you have the reason why Sir John precipitated
the matter. And mind you, if
you do find that to be true, it’s pretty good
confirmation that all the rest of the supposition
I put to you will hold water.”</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the party broke off, and
Tempest heard no more of the matter until
ten days later, when Baxter called to show
him a copy of the birth-certificate of an
unnamed female child, born in Dublin on
the 18th of August, 1881, and registered as
the daughter of John Rellingham, solicitor,
and Sarah Jane, formerly Manuel. Tempest
laughed as he read the certificate through.
“Isn’t it funny,” he said, “that when we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
were hunting high and low for the birth
of that child, it never entered our heads to
look for a daughter of Sir John? She’s
registered in the right name, too.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen Allingham. You were quite
right in your guess. He thoroughly examined
Sir John about a month before the
date of the murder. It wasn’t heart disease.
It was cancer of the throat. He
told Sir John he could count on at least
three months. He strongly advised an
operation, and Sir John was very much
inclined to agree; in fact it was almost
arranged, but it would have been a very
risky operation.”</p>

<p>“Then, that’s why he was making his
arrangements? Didn’t he say anything to
any of you three?”</p>

<p>“Not a word; but then he was always
very reserved about himself.”</p>

<p>The barrister hummed a tune, and then,
lighting a cigarette, fell to pacing his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
room, as he always did when working out
his problems.</p>

<p>“Well, Baxter, Sir John provoked that
interview, which we presume was about
the secret trust, in order to make the different
parts of the key to the cryptogram
ready to work, in case he died before Evangeline
came of age. Do you remember
that letter you found copied in his private
letter-book? That was an invitation to the
interview. Now, knowing it was going to
take place, knowing he had to provide for
Evangeline’s future, he goes to see you the
night before and asks you to marry the girl.
Then he could have settled everything by
leaving the money to you. That would
have excited no comment, and probably he
would have abandoned his secret trust, and
no doubt he would have taken a different
line at the interview. But you wouldn’t
promise unconditionally to marry the
girl?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>“He wanted me to marry her in a day
or two’s time by special licence. I couldn’t
do it. I’d never seen the girl.”</p>

<p>“And Sir John knew he couldn’t wait.”</p>

<p>“I almost wish I’d consented. I wonder
if it would have altered matters?”</p>

<p>“That we shall never know.”</p>

<p>The solicitor was grave enough as he
added, “Something else has happened.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“What do you guess, Tempest?”</p>

<p>“How do I know, unless you’ve found
the lady?”</p>

<p>Baxter pitched him a letter across the
table. The barrister picked it up and
read it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“135 <span class="smcap">Chancery Lane</span>, W. C.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sirs</span>,—We are instructed by our
client, Lady Rellingham, relict of Sir John
Rellingham, deceased, late the senior partner
in your firm, to make formal claim to
the £20,000 held in trust for her, under Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
John’s will, by yourselves, his surviving
partners and executors. The terms of the
will are before us, and of course these do
not specifically allude to Lady Rellingham
by that or any other name or description;
but we are enclosing a copy, and are prepared
to produce, for your inspection, the
original of a letter from the late Sir John
Rellingham, in his own handwriting,
which can leave no doubt of his intentions,
and we have no doubt it will be in accord
with those directions to yourself to which
the will alludes. We should have ventured
to express our surprise that the
money should have remained in your hands
so long, and that during that time no effort
should have been made to fulfil the obligations
of the trust, were it not that our client
informs us that she has been abroad for
many years past, that her marriage to Sir
John has always been kept a profound
secret, and that she was, until quite recently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
unaware of Sir John’s death. We are prepared
to produce, as and when required,
proof of the marriage of Sir John to our
client and of her identity. Our client has
no desire to encourage any greater publicity
than may be necessary in view of the
terms of separation which had long existed
between herself and her husband; in fact,
she would prefer to maintain the silence
which has hitherto been observed concerning
the marriage. In this we trust you
will feel disposed and able to act in unison
and conformity with such expression of her
wishes; and we should suppose, as he subsequently
contracted a bigamous marriage,
that for the sake of Sir John Rellingham’s
reputation, you would yourselves prefer to
do so. But, of course, the large sum at
stake precludes any suggestion of less
favourable terms being accepted merely
to obtain an avoidance of publicity. If
you require publicity, our client will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
shrink from it.—We are, dear sirs, yours
faithfully, <span class="smcap">Clutch</span> &amp; <span class="smcap">Holdem</span>.</p>

<p>“To Messrs. Rellingham, Baxter, Marston &amp; Moorhouse.”</p>
</div>

<p>The enclosure was as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear</span>,—As a tangible evidence of
my wish when you claim the money which
I am leaving in trust for you to have, if
you are so placed that you ever need it
after I am gone, I write you this letter.
You understand it, so will my partners
when you produce it.—Yours most affectionately,
<span class="smcap">John Rellingham</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“What do you think of it, Tempest?”
asked the solicitor.</p>

<p>“It’s precisely what I’ve been expecting.”</p>

<p>“Expecting! Why should you expect
it?”</p>

<p>“When I told the judge in open court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
(I shouldn’t have said it, of course, if I
hadn’t known of the duplicate set of
papers), but when I told him that the directions
for the disposal of the trust were
in a sealed packet, and that that packet had
been destroyed, and that you three didn’t
yourselves know what were the original intentions
of Sir John in creating the trust, I
felt pretty confident you would have a crop
of bogus claims. This is the first. I was
inviting them, and I knew it.”</p>

<p>“But this looks genuine. They have
the fact of the marriage. That is not public
property, but we know it is true.”</p>

<p>“Quite so, Baxter; but at least three
other people, the witnesses and the parson,
must also have known it originally. And
goodness only knows who they have since
told, and very likely there are several other
people as well,—the relatives of Sir John’s
wife.”</p>

<p>“But the letter fits so well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>“Of course it does; but in view of what
the public know, anybody could have concocted
that letter. It could have been made
to fit. You weren’t likely to have a letter
fired at you that wouldn’t fit. Now, there
are these points you must bear in mind: (1)
The letter may be a forgery. (2) There
may be no Lady Rellingham now in existence,
and this may be a simple ramp on
the part of Clutch &amp; Holdem—you know
the sort of reputation that firm has? (3)
They may have a client who is claiming to
be Lady Rellingham, but who is nothing of
the kind. (4) But even if she is Lady
Rellingham, and even if the letter is genuine,
it doesn’t follow that it refers to the
secret trust. Then added to all that, by a
decree of the court, under the terms of the
will, the money now belongs to you three
in fee simple.”</p>

<p>“But we’ve reconstituted the trust.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but who knows except yourselves?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
That didn’t come out in court.
All that came out was, that you three still
held the money.”</p>

<p>“Is that a complete answer?”</p>

<p>“I’m not quite sure. I work on the
common law side, and I don’t want to dogmatise
on a chancery point; but it seems to
me at any rate arguable that if the trust is
a simple trust for her benefit, claimable by
her on Sir John’s death, if she were then
alive, then it had already vested in her
before the Treasury took action against you,
and consequently the trust created by the
will was at an end, and the money would
be her absolute property before the court
decrees it to yourselves. If it were hers I
should fancy the decree could hardly divest
her of her absolute property. You’ll probably
have to open that packet, if the thing
is pressed, for it has the semblance of being
a genuine claim and one that looks <i>prima
facie</i> as if it might be substantiated.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“Do you recommend us to pay or get
out the papers?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t get ’em out yet. Sir John
trusted you all so implicitly that I wouldn’t
get them out until the very last resort. If
this is a mere bluff, you may stop it by
bluffing back. Go and see the letter, and
if it’s in Sir John’s handwriting, then ask
for proof of the marriage and proof of
identity. When those are forthcoming, if
they are, simply point-blank refuse to pay,
and see what happens. Say that under the
judgment of the court the trust is over and
the money vested in yourselves. Here, I’ll
draft you the reply.”</p>

<p>Seating himself at his writing-table
Tempest wrote as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Messrs. <span class="smcap">Clutch</span> &amp; <span class="smcap">Holdem</span>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sirs</span>,—Without attempting to
discuss the merits of the claim, if any,
which your client may conceive herself to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
possess, we would refer you to the terms of
the will of Sir John Rellingham, of which
you appear to have ample knowledge. We
would remind you that the Crown commenced
legal proceedings against us, to
compel a disclosure of the terms of the
trust; that we resisted this; and that the
court decreed that under the expressed
terms of Sir John’s will the capital funds
had vested in us as our absolute property.—Yours
faithfully, <span class="smcap">Rellingham</span>, <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>,
<span class="smcap">Marston</span> &amp; <span class="smcap">Moorhouse</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>The solicitor read the draft.</p>

<p>“I don’t like it, Tempest. All three of
us are ready and anxious to pay over the
money, if this be really Sir John’s intention.”</p>

<p>“Of course I know that; but the odds
are so heavy that this is a bogus claim that
you are bound to fight it.”</p>

<p>By return of post came the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
reply, which Baxter took round to his
chambers for Tempest to see:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sirs</span>,—We are surprised at the
tone and contents of your letter. We had
not overlooked the facts you allude to, but
we are advised by counsel that the trust
moneys had already become vested in our
client before the Crown took action, and
that therefore the decree is of no weight.
We shall be glad if you will give the matter
further consideration, as we do not wish to
resort to litigation unnecessarily.—Yours
faithfully, <span class="smcap">Clutch</span> &amp; <span class="smcap">Holdem</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“This seems to be getting interesting,”
said Tempest as he read the letter.</p>

<p>“Now write to them, and ask them to
produce, for your inspection, the original
of the letter written by Sir John and the
certificate of the marriage. You should
also ask them how they propose to prove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
the identity of their client with the lady
who married Sir John? Let me know
what they say.”</p>

<p>The letter was duly written; and Tempest
learned afterwards from Baxter that
there could be no doubt whatever that the
letter had been written by Sir John. “It’s
on the firm’s paper. It’s all in his own
handwriting. It couldn’t have been forged
so perfectly. You see, it isn’t just the
question of a signature.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, I take it that Sir John
wrote it. Did you ask to see the envelope.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and I was told it was given personally
to Lady Rellingham by Sir John,
and was never put into an envelope.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s important; as the admission,
if it were true, would prove she had seen
Sir John since or at the date of the making
of the will. Anything else?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was written in the new copying-ink.
I told you about that once before, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
it must have been written within a week or
so before he died.”</p>

<p>“Had the letter been copied?”</p>

<p>“Yes, press-copied. That was evident.”</p>

<p>“Can you find the copy in Sir John’s
private book?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ve looked carefully. It isn’t
there.”</p>

<p>“Are there any pages torn out?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ve gone carefully through the
pages. There are no numbers missing.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell you where the press-copy
is—it’s in the sealed packet. There were
probably two copies taken. Baxter, that
letter was never written to Lady Rellingham.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“It’s written in terms of genuine affection.
If Sir John had been on such terms
with his wife, he would not have been
separated from her so completely that not
one of you three had ever heard of her existence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
Why, Sir John couldn’t have
known she were still alive, or he wouldn’t
have married a second time.”</p>

<p>“Then who was it written to?”</p>

<p>“Evangeline Stableford.”</p>

<p>“Then how did it come into Lady Rellingham’s
hands?”</p>

<p>“Assuming there is a person posing
as Lady Rellingham, you get a motive
which may account for the fact that Evangeline
was murdered. I’m not sure at
present that it was the actual motive.
There may, perhaps, have been another,
but the letter was stolen at the time of her
death. You know I’ve always said she was
murdered by that woman who was staying
in the hotel in the name of Mrs. Garnett.
Mrs. Garnett is the woman who is now
posing as Lady Rellingham. She is the
woman who was in the court on those two
occasions—the woman Yardley tracked to
the Hotel Victoria, where she was staying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
as Mrs. Seymour. Now, mark you! the
letter is not used on Sir John’s death. It
is not used until I have declared, in open
court, that the directions for disposing of
the trust have been destroyed. Clutch &amp;
Holdem have probably got as their client
that woman Mrs. Garnett, but it doesn’t
absolutely follow she is identical with Lady
Rellingham. Still, I think she must be.
You see, Evangeline was the legitimate
daughter of Sir John. I’ve felt fairly
certain all along that Mrs. Garnett was
Evangeline’s mother.”</p>

<p>“Well, what had we better do? I’m here
for professional advice, Tempest.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you must decline to pay. Say you
will accept service of a writ, as you prefer
to submit the matter to the arbitrament of
the court. I’ll keep your name straight
before the court. Nobody shall go away
with the impression that you were declining
to pay simply so that you could stick to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
the money. You see, Baxter, they must
produce their client in court. They can’t
get out of doing it. The only documents
they can cite are the will and this letter.
As the two stand together they don’t prove
their case. They must obviously explain
the letter by the evidence of their client.
You must have the papers in court, in case
the jury seem inclined to believe the woman.
We’ll open the packet there, if
necessary. This letter from Sir John is
obviously the eventuality he created and
ample justification for your opening the
packet; but, as I am pretty sure it has got
into the wrong hands, we won’t meddle
with the secret until it becomes unavoidable,
and then we’ll cross-examine this
Lady Rellingham.”</p>

<p>“Can we keep the papers secret until
then? Surely Clutch &amp; Holdem will get
discovery?”</p>

<p>“How can they? They can’t get a general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
fishing order. They can only get discovery
of documents they can specify.”</p>

<p>“But they’ll require an affidavit of documents?”</p>

<p>“I suppose they will. Put into the affidavit
the sealed packet you had, and say
that it was destroyed. They know that
much. They will never dream of there
being a duplicate set of papers. Why, this
action is only brought because they know
the papers have been destroyed. Besides,
the set which are now at the safe deposit
place have never been reduced into custody
yet. I tell you what. Don’t swear an affidavit
of documents at all. Don’t wait till
you are asked for one, but treat it as all in
the day’s march; and, before they ask, send
them an informal list of your documents.
Send it with a kind of put-off letter, saying
you don’t wish to inconvenience them, so
send them at once a list of the documents,
and say that a thorough search is being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
made amongst the office papers for additional
papers, if any; and consequently,
with their consent, you will postpone
swearing a formal affidavit till the last moment.
Then forget all about it. They’ll
probably never tumble to what your game
is. They’ve very likely got one or two
documents themselves which they would
rather keep up their sleeve at the moment,
so, if you don’t worry them for their affidavit,
very likely they won’t bother you.
They think they know you have nothing of
the least importance.”</p>

<p>In due course the case came on for hearing
in one of the chancery courts. Barnett,
K. C., and Mr. Hayford were for
Lady Rellingham; Tempest was alone, as
usual, for the surviving partners in the
firm of Rellingham, Baxter, Marston &amp;
Moorhouse.</p>

<p>In an easy tone the well-known K. C.
opened the case. He dwelt at some length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
on the strange circumstances of the death
of Sir John Rellingham, described how he
had been found murdered, and mentioned
the newspaper agitation which had resulted
first in the action taken by the
Crown against the partners to compel disclosure
of the terms of the trust, which action
had resulted in the court decreeing the
capital moneys to be the property of the
surviving partners in their own right.
“We now know,” said Mr. Barnett, “that
in defiance of the injunction of the court,
certainly an order obtained <i>ex parte</i>, but
a valid injunction nevertheless, the partners
and executors of Sir John took it upon
themselves to destroy the sealed packet
containing Sir John’s instructions as to the
conduct and disposal of the trust.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that, Mr. Barnett?”</p>

<p>“My lord,” answered the K. C., “my
learned friend who is against me in this
case made a statement to that effect a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
weeks ago, when acting for one of the partners
in a motion in one of the other courts
concerning the distribution of the money.
I presume he will not contradict his previous
statement?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear no!” said Tempest, without
rising from his seat. “If my learned
friend’s client hadn’t known the papers
had been destroyed, she wouldn’t have
dared to bring this action.”</p>

<p>“I can only say,” continued the K. C.,
“that this is a most improper observation
to have made, and I am surprised at my
learned friend allowing such a scandalous
suggestion to have been put into his
mouth.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Barnett,” said the judge with a
smile, “we hear many scandalous suggestions
of that kind in this court. I should
have thought that, with your experience of
them, you would hardly allowed your imperturbable
equanimity to be ruffled by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
what Mr. Tempest said. He has still to
prove it, you know.”</p>

<p>“Quite so, my lord;” and then the K. C.
passed to another result of the newspaper
agitation which had been “the cause of the
arrest and trial of Mr. Baxter, one of the
defendants in the present case, for the murder
of his partner, the late Sir John Rellingham.
I know your lordship will permit
me to dissociate myself and my client
from any possible accusation of repeating
any such suggestion here. Rather, if I
may, would I tender to Mr. Baxter congratulations
on behalf of our mutual profession
at the happy issue of those proceedings,
and I would congratulate my learned
friend as well, for he was closely concerned
in that issue.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Barnett, aren’t you rather on the
horns of a dilemma? If you congratulate
Mr. Tempest too much, you’ll be making
the very suggestion you repudiate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>A smile went round the court, and, as
the ushers called for “silence,” the learned
counsel resumed his speech.</p>

<p>“The delay in bringing this action, my
lord, or rather the delay in making the
claim which has resulted in this action,
was not due to the reason suggested in the
innuendo of my learned friend, but simply
to the fact that Lady Rellingham was absent
from England, and was not aware of
the death of Sir John. I cannot ignore the
unhappy fact, my lord—it is bound to
come out in these proceedings; but Sir
John and Lady Rellingham separated
within a few months of their marriage, and
since that separation never again cohabited
with each other, and I understand never
again met each other. So complete was
this separation, that it came as a great surprise
to all of us, including those of us who
had known the late Sir John Rellingham
intimately, to be informed that he had ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
been married before his marriage to the
late Lady Rellingham, whom we all knew.
My client will go into the box, my lord,
and will give the court the short history of
her brief married life. I shall put in the
certificate of the marriage. None of the
witnesses are now alive. It was a marriage
in a London city church; and the two
witnesses, the verger and a cleaner, were
then both old, and they and the clergyman
who performed the ceremony are all dead.
But I shall call before your lordship the
mother of the plaintiff, who will identify
her daughter. She was aware of her marriage;
and there cannot therefore be any
objection, successfully upheld, that my client,
Lady Rellingham, is any other person
than the lady who went through the ceremony
of marriage with Sir John. The
real difficulty I have to face, my lord, is
that the terms of Sir John’s will are so
strange. Not only does he create a secret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
trust, but he attached to it this curious
clause:</p>

<p>“‘And I further direct that if at any time
this trust or the capital moneys of this trust
shall be or shall become the subject matter
of litigation through the interference or intervention
of any party or parties other
than my said partners, or the survivor or
survivors of them, then and forthwith, and
from the commencement of such litigation,
the said trust shall cease and determine,
and the capital sums of the said trust shall
be distributed and applied in the form and
manner next above provided.’”</p>

<p>“What was that form and manner, Mr.
Barnett?”</p>

<p>“Your lordship has a copy of the will
before you. The previous clause directs
the distribution of the money amongst the
partners for their own benefit in a certain
eventually.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>“Now, the surviving partners of the late
Sir John profess ignorance of the original
purposes of the trust. They assert that
their instructions were sealed in a packet
which was only to be opened in a certain
eventuality; and they say, also, that those
instructions directed them, in the event of
litigation, to destroy the parcel unopened.</p>

<p>“The Crown commenced litigation.
The parcel was destroyed. But the result
of that litigation was that, under the clause
in Sir John’s will, which I have just read
to your lordship, the court decrees the trust
funds to have vested in the three surviving
partners in their own right. But if the
trustees and executors are really in the entire
ignorance they suggest, we are not.
Not only was Lady Rellingham aware of
the purposes of the trust, but what we believe
are the actual terms of the instructions
concerning it were within her knowledge.
Amongst certain papers of Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
John’s, which were in her possession, is a
paper containing these words:—</p>

<p>“‘Upon trust, to be settled tightly for
her exclusive use and benefit, without
power of alienation or anticipation in the
names of suitable trustees, the new trust
deed to be executed immediately after my
death, and to contain a clause cancelling
the trust created by my will.’</p>

<p>“That paper was given to Lady Rellingham
at the same time as the letter which I
shall presently read to your lordship and
which she was to show to the trustees and
executors. Now, my lord, if, as I submit,
we have a right to assume those were either
the actual words or an epitome of the instructions
Sir John left to his executors,
then I submit to your lordship that it was
their duty to at once transfer this money,
and themselves create this trust in favour of
Lady Rellingham. I submit it had vested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
in her as the beneficiary, and, as a new
trust, was not subject to the clause by which
litigation transferred it to the surviving
partners. Alternatively, my lord, I shall
submit, that if the old trust still existed,
and the money therefore under the terms of
the will was still subject to the forfeiture
clause, and was accordingly forfeited, then
the trustees were guilty of negligence in
not having constituted the new trust, and
through their negligence Lady Rellingham
has found the provision made for her
forfeited through causes over which she
had no control, and for which negligence
she is entitled to damages. Her statement
of claim, my lord, as you will see, alleges
the further negligence that the forfeiture
was consequent upon the refusal of the partners
to disclose the terms of the trust, and
that they were not justified in that refusal,
but, on the other hand, deliberately provoked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
the litigation which resulted in the
forfeiture. Before calling my client, my
lord, I propose to proceed chronologically
by first proving the marriage.”</p>

<p>Formal proof of the marriage and the
certificate was given, and then Mr. Barnett
called “Esther Manuel.”</p>

<p>An old woman, dressed plainly but inexpensively,
came forward, and was sworn.
She gave her name and her residence in
Nassau Street, Dublin, and said that she
was the widow of Pedro Manuel.</p>

<p>“Who was Pedro Manuel?”</p>

<p>“He was a hairdresser.”</p>

<p>“Where did he carry on business?”</p>

<p>“In Dublin.”</p>

<p>“When did he die?”</p>

<p>“Eight years after my marriage, in
1865.”</p>

<p>“How many children had you?”</p>

<p>“Two daughters.”</p>

<p>“When were they born?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>“Sarah Jane was born in 1858 and
Dorothy in 1860.”</p>

<p>“What has became of Dorothy?”</p>

<p>“She died about twenty years ago. I
don’t know the exact date.”</p>

<p>“Where did she die?”</p>

<p>“In London.”</p>

<p>“Now, your elder daughter. Do you
see her in court?”</p>

<p>“Yes—that lady;” and the old woman
pointed to the plaintiff, who was seated at
the solicitor’s table.</p>

<p>“Will you raise your veil, please, Lady
Rellingham?” said the judge. “Now,”
he added, turning to the witness, “is that
your daughter Sarah Jane?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m positive. I should know
her anywhere.”</p>

<p>As Lady Rellingham raised her veil for
a moment, Tempest saw her face and
started in amazement. An older woman
certainly, but nevertheless the likeness to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
Evangeline Stableford was startling in the
extreme. There could be no doubt of the
relationship of those two.</p>

<p>Tempest rose to cross-examine. “When
did your daughters leave home?”</p>

<p>“Oh, many a year ago! I couldn’t tell
you the date.”</p>

<p>“How old were they?”</p>

<p>“I think Sarah Jane was seventeen or
eighteen, and Dorothy was two years
younger.”</p>

<p>“Why did they leave home? Was there
any quarrel?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir. They left home to go into
service. I found it very hard to support
them, and they had good situations offered
to them.”</p>

<p>“What were the situations?”</p>

<p>“They went to some dressmaker’s shop
here in London. I forget the name.”</p>

<p>“When was the next time you saw
them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>“I never saw Dorothy again. She
died.”</p>

<p>“Did they write to you?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes; but not often. I’m not
much of a scholar myself, and I couldn’t
write back, so I suppose they got tired of
writing.”</p>

<p>“When did you next see your daughter
Sarah Jane?”</p>

<p>The witness hesitated, but the question
was pressed, and finally came the answer,
“Yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Then, from the day they left home until
yesterday, an interval of between twenty
and thirty years, you have never set eyes on
your daughter?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“And yet you are positive she is your
daughter?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did you know of her marriage?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>“When did you hear of it?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say exactly. She wrote and
told me she had married a rich man, and
since then she’s always allowed me ten shillings
a week, and with the little bit of
money I had that made me very comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Did you know whom she married?”</p>

<p>“No. I didn’t know the name.”</p>

<p>“How did you address your letters to
her when you wrote?”</p>

<p>“I used to write them to Miss Manuel.
She told me to.”</p>

<p>“What address did you send them to?”</p>

<p>“I always sent them to her at an address
she gave me.” The old lady mentioned
the address, but it told Tempest nothing.
He guessed it to be an accommodation
address—a surmise which subsequently
proved correct.</p>

<p>“How did you get to know of your
daughter Dorothy’s death?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“Sarah Jane—her ladyship—wrote and
told me.”</p>

<p>“Did she tell you where she died?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember, sir. I don’t think
so.”</p>

<p>“Did she tell you what was the cause of
her death?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I wrote and asked her to send
me word about it, but I didn’t hear again
after that from Sarah Jane for a long time,
and then she wrote and said she’d been living
in France.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever write and ask your
daughter Sarah Jane who it was she had
married?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did she tell you?”</p>

<p>“No. She said she had to keep her
marriage quite secret, and it was safest to
say nothing.”</p>

<p>“Did either of your daughters tell you
when they left their situation?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then, for all you knew to the contrary,
Sarah Jane might still have been there all
these years?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, she said she had married a
rich man, so naturally I didn’t suppose
she would have to go on working for her
living.”</p>

<p>“Did she ever send you word whether
she had a child?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you know now whether or not she
has ever had one?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>Lady Rellingham was the next witness
called, and, in answer to her counsel, said
she left home about the year 1875. It
might be 1876; she could not be certain.
She had left home with her sister, and they
both obtained situations in the same milliner’s
shop. There she had met Mr. John
Rellingham, as he then was, and she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
married him after a very short engagement.
Their marriage had been kept secret
by her wish at first. She did not wish
to give up her employment. They never
had a joint home. She and her sister
shared rooms, and she used to go away
with her husband for week ends.</p>

<p>“Then I think you separated from your
husband. Can you tell the court the
reason?”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t get on. We were always
quarrelling, and we both felt it was hopeless
to pretend to keep up the farce of appearing
fond of each other. So we just
agreed to part. That was easy. Because
no one knew of our marriage except my
sister.”</p>

<p>“Did Sir John make any provision for
you?”</p>

<p>“He allowed me an income for a few
years, and then it ceased.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever see Sir John again?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>“Not until shortly before his death,
when he gave me the letter and paper I
produce.”</p>

<p>“Do you identify this letter (and it was
handed to the witness) as in the handwriting
of Sir John?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is in his writing.”</p>

<p>“You are perfectly familiar with his
writing? Now, this other paper—is that
in his handwriting?”</p>

<p>“No. He had it ready written out, and
he gave it me with the letter.”</p>

<p>“Why were they given to you?”</p>

<p>“So that I could claim the money which
he told me he was putting into trust for me
under his will.”</p>

<p>“What was the reason for making it a
secret trust and not leaving it to you by
name?”</p>

<p>“Sir John still wished our marriage
kept secret. You see, he had been married
again himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>“Do you swear on your oath that Sir
John intended that trust for your benefit?”</p>

<p>“He told me so. He told me I should
only have to show that letter to his partners,
that they would understand it; and
he gave me the paper, and told me that
those were the instructions he had left for
his partners.”</p>

<p>“I really don’t know how much of this
is evidence,” interrupted the judge.</p>

<p>Tempest rose. “I make no objection to
it, my lord. I am not here to assist my clients
to retain money which should rightly
go elsewhere; and under the curious, I
might say the utterly weird, circumstances
of this present case, I think it very desirable
we should have all possible information
we can get.”</p>

<p>“If you raise no objection, Mr. Tempest,
I am very much inclined to agree with
you;” and the examination was continued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>“When did you hear of Sir John’s
death?”</p>

<p>“Only a few weeks ago. I have been
travelling in Egypt.”</p>

<p>“And that is the reason, I understand,
why you have only recently instructed your
solicitors to claim the money?”</p>

<p>“That is so;” and the examination then
closed, and Tempest began to cross-examine.</p>

<p>“For how long, Lady Rellingham, have
you used that title?”</p>

<p>“Only since I commenced this claim.”</p>

<p>“That, I take it, is since the death of Sir
John, and since he has been unable to raise
objection to your doing so. Is not that the
case?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What name were you known by previously?”</p>

<p>“My maiden name was Sarah Jane
Manuel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>“What name were you known by previously,
Lady Rellingham, if you please?”</p>

<p>“I decline to answer.”</p>

<p>“Will you answer my question, please?”</p>

<p>“I decline to.”</p>

<p>“Was it the name of another man?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Was that why Sir John Rellingham
ceased to pay your allowance?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>The question was pressed.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it was.”</p>

<p>“What was the reason?”</p>

<p>“My husband thought I was dead.”</p>

<p>Tempest’s face plainly showed his surprise.</p>

<p>“How did you know he thought you
were dead?”</p>

<p>“He heard of the death of my sister, and
must have thought it was my death, for he
wrote to my sister to condole with her, and
offering to pay the expenses of the funeral.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
It suited me to let him think so, so I answered
it in my sister’s name, and I never
undeceived him.”</p>

<p>“If he thought you were dead, then why
did he wish to provide for you by making
this trust?”</p>

<p>“He found out his mistake.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“We met, and he recognised me.”</p>

<p>“When did you meet?”</p>

<p>“It was just before his death, when he
gave me that letter and the paper.”</p>

<p>“How was it you came to meet?”</p>

<p>“He wrote that he had some business he
wanted to discuss with me.”</p>

<p>“But he thought you were dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but he thought my sister—his sister-in-law—was
alive.”</p>

<p>Tempest hunted through his papers, and
then, turning to the witness, asked, “Was
this the letter?” and Tempest read out:</p>

<p>“‘Sir John Rellingham has received and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
carefully considered the letter. In the exercise
of his discretion, he must decline the
request. He cannot but think the interview
was essential.’”</p>

<p>“It was something like that.”</p>

<p>“Was that the letter, please? Yes or
no?”</p>

<p>“I believe it was.”</p>

<p>“Did the interview take place after you
received that letter?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then we can date it. That letter was
written within a week of Sir John’s death.”</p>

<p>“Do you propose to prove that, Mr.
Tempest?” asked the judge.</p>

<p>“Certainly, my lord—now that it has become
material.—Now, do I understand
that, until that interview took place, Sir
John Rellingham had no idea that you, his
wife, were still alive?”</p>

<p>“That is so.”</p>

<p>“Lady Rellingham, Sir John died in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
week preceding Easter in 1902. If he
were not aware you were alive until the interview
took place in 1902, how do you account
for the fact that his will was made
in 1900—the trust drawn up in 1900—a
trust which you say was for your benefit,
whereas he did not know in 1900, when he
drew his will, that you were alive?”</p>

<p>There was no answer, and, time after
time, the question was repeated. Lady
Rellingham got whiter and whiter, till her
face was a pale ashy grey; but she made
not even a suggestion in reply. At last
came her whispered reply, “I cannot
say.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Tempest, of course it’s quite possible—mind,
I do not say it is so—but it is
possible that the trust may have been created
for the benefit of someone else, and
Sir John may have changed his mind,
when he became aware that his wife was
still alive.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>Tempest listened in growing irritation
as the judge helped the witness out of the
pitfall he had dug so carefully for her, and
curtly answered:</p>

<p>“That is a point I shall have to discuss
at some length a little later;” and then,
turning to the witness, he asked: “Did
Sir John write this letter and this paper in
your presence?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and handed them to me.”</p>

<p>“Where did this interview take place?”</p>

<p>“At his office.”</p>

<p>“How is it, then, that neither of Sir
John’s partners nor any of the clerks in the
office are aware of such an interview having
taken place?”</p>

<p>“It was after office hours, and all the
clerks had gone.”</p>

<p>“Who admitted you?”</p>

<p>“Sir John himself. He had made the
appointment, and expected us.”</p>

<p>“Did Sir John leave you in his room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
and go into any other room whilst you were
there?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then, Lady Rellingham, how do you
account for this letter having been press-copied?”</p>

<p>“I really cannot tell. Perhaps he did
it in his own room, and I never noticed him
copying it. I don’t know how letters are
copied.”</p>

<p>“But I do know, Lady Rellingham. It
needs a press to press-copy a letter, and the
press is in the clerks’ office.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we were in the clerks’ office?”</p>

<p>“Will you describe the room, Lady Rellingham?”</p>

<p>“It was a room on the first floor, not
looking into the square, and it had a large
table and some chairs.”</p>

<p>“Then, Lady Rellingham, if I can
prove the clerks’ offices are all on the
ground floor, and that none of them have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
chairs or tables, but all have desks and
stools, you must be mistaken?”</p>

<p>“Are you going to prove that, Mr. Tempest?”</p>

<p>“Oh certainly, my lord; if you wish it.
Now, Lady Rellingham, a moment ago
you said Sir John admitted you. Your exact
words were, ‘He had made the appointment
and expected us.’ Who was the
other person?”</p>

<p>“That was a mistake. I went alone.”</p>

<p>“Did you expect to meet anyone else
there?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Did anyone else go there?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Was no one else present at the interview
between yourself and Sir John?”</p>

<p>“No one at all.”</p>

<p>“What time was it when the interview
took place?”</p>

<p>“About a quarter to seven.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>“And none of the clerks were present?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Now, Lady Rellingham, if I can
prove, as I am going to do presently—now
just listen, please—if I can prove that that
letter was written less than a week before
Sir John died, and that during that week
there was only one evening on which all of
the clerks had gone before seven o’clock,
and that on that evening Sir John sent the
last one away at half-past six, that must
have been the evening the interview took
place?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“And if that evening was the evening
Sir John was murdered, you must have
been the last person who saw Sir John
alive? Now, Lady Rellingham, I will
ask you again, was no one else present at
the interview between Sir John and yourself?”</p>

<p>“There was someone else.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>“I thought so. Who was that other
person?”</p>

<p>“I decline to say.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you see, Lady Rellingham,
that if that other person can corroborate
what you say, you have won your case. If,
as you admit, there was another person, and
you don’t call that person as a witness, the
natural presumption is that you are afraid
to do so because that person would tell a
different story. Now, who was that other
person?”</p>

<p>“The other person is dead.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll leave that point for the
present. Have you any children, Lady
Rellingham?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Tempest handed the witness a birth-certificate.
“Isn’t that the certificate of the
birth of a daughter of Sir John and yourself?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>“Then, why did you say you had no children?”</p>

<p>“You asked me if I have any children.
That child was adopted by somebody very
soon after it was born. I didn’t want anyone
to know I had had a child.”</p>

<p>“Who adopted it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I told the monthly
nurse to make arrangements, and it was
adopted on condition that I was not to
know where it went, and I was never to
claim it.”</p>

<p>“Was your husband with you when the
child was born?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Did he know you had had a child?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Did he know what became of it?”</p>

<p>“I think he found out afterwards.”</p>

<p>“Did he tell you what name it was
known by, or what had become of it when
you had this interview with him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What was the name?”</p>

<p>“I decline to say.”</p>

<p>“I insist on your answering;” and as the
witness remained silent, the judge intervened.
“You know, Lady Rellingham, I
can commit you to prison if you do not answer;
and if you do not tell the truth, you
will be guilty of perjury.”</p>

<p>“Lady Rellingham, I put it to you that
your daughter went by the name of Evangeline
Stableford. Is not that a fact?”
And reluctantly came the admission that it
was.</p>

<p>“Now, then, I put it to you that the
other person who was present was Evangeline
Stableford. Isn’t that so?”</p>

<p>And that was admitted.</p>

<p>“Now, didn’t Sir John tell you he was
suffering from cancer of the throat, and
was going to be operated on?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>“Didn’t he remind you that Evangeline
had not yet come of age?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he say he hoped Lady Stableford
would provide for her adopted
daughter, Evangeline, in her will?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But there was always the chance that
Lady Stableford might change her mind,
and that Evangeline had no legal claim on
her?”</p>

<p>“He might have done.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think he did.”</p>

<p>“Now, you say he thought you were
Evangeline’s aunt and not her mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then, was it that he wished to leave
Evangeline in your charge in case he died
under the operation, and before Evangeline
came of age, that he had sent for
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“And your story is that when he saw you
he recognised you as his wife?”</p>

<p>“Yes; that is what happened.”</p>

<p>“And that, whatever may have been his
previous intentions, he thereupon changed
his mind and wrote the letter, so that you
should benefit by the trust.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I promised him to leave the
money to Evangeline at my death, that is,
if Lady Stableford did not provide for
her.”</p>

<p>“Lady Rellingham, isn’t the real fact
that Sir John had known you were alive
for some five or six years—before he ever
made the will which you say was to benefit
you?”</p>

<p>“He may, perhaps, have done. He
may have seen me, and recognised me,
without my knowledge.”</p>

<p>“Lady Rellingham,” said Tempest in
his quiet voice as he leaned forward, “isn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
it the fact that Sir John had found out you
were alive and living under another man’s
name, and he sent for you and sent for
Evangeline, and he told you, in her presence,
that he knew and had known, but that
he was going to respect your secret, if it
could be protected, so long as you lived;
and that if he died before Evangeline came
of age, and that if then Lady Stableford
had not provided for her, Evangeline was
to be able to claim the money he put in
trust; but that, as that would probably result
in your secret being disclosed, he gave
you the opportunity of providing for
Evangeline during your lifetime, so that
your secret need not be revealed whilst you
were alive? Isn’t that the real fact?”</p>

<p>“No, it is not.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it the fact that that letter was
written for Evangeline and given to her in
your presence?”</p>

<p>“No, certainly not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>“Lady Rellingham, I know your secret.
Isn’t what I put to you the fact?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“Did Evangeline know?”</p>

<p>“No. I stopped him telling her. She
only knew I was her mother.”</p>

<p>“I’ve tried to keep your secret. I’m
afraid it will have to come out now;” and
then, turning to Baxter, he said, “Let me
have that parcel,” and a sealed packet was
handed to him.</p>

<p>“Lady Rellingham,” said Tempest,
“did Sir John tell you that the instructions
to his partners as to the execution of the
trust were in a sealed packet, and that they
would not be aware of the contents until
the time came for them to act?”</p>

<p>“He did.”</p>

<p>“You were aware that that parcel was
destroyed unopened?”</p>

<p>“I saw it in the papers that you said so
in court.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>“Did Sir John tell you he had created a
duplicate, in case that parcel was destroyed?”</p>

<p>“No, he did not.”</p>

<p>“It’s news to you, then, that there was
such a duplicate?”</p>

<p>“Quite news. I don’t believe it.”</p>

<p>“You won’t believe me, then, if I tell
you this is the duplicate?”</p>

<p>“No, I shall not. You’re only trying to
frighten me.”</p>

<p>“Are you willing to let this case depend
upon the result of opening this duplicate?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. How do I know it’s
genuine?”</p>

<p>“I shall require you to prove that, Mr.
Tempest,” said the judge.</p>

<p>“As your lordship pleases,” replied the
barrister.</p>

<p>“My lord,” said Mr. Barnett, “I shall
strongly object to the production of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
document. It is not mentioned in their
affidavit of documents.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the remotest idea what is in
the parcel,” said Tempest. “I imagine the
documents it contains will be in the handwriting
of Sir John, and will practically
prove themselves. But I can assure my
learned friend that I was only intending to
use the contents in cross-examination. He
seems much more afraid of them than I
am.”</p>

<p>As Tempest took a pen-knife from his
pocket and cut the sealed string, there was
a dramatic pause, and the court hushed into
breathless silence. One could hear the
wax breaking as the string was cut; and
Lady Rellingham, gripping the rail of the
witness-box, gasped towards her solicitor,
“I withdraw! I withdraw!”</p>

<p>“Then, my lord, I ask you to order the
arrest of the witness.”</p>

<p>“On what ground, Mr. Tempest?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>“Perjury, my lord, at least.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t proved that her evidence
is incorrect?”</p>

<p>“I take it, my lord, that her withdrawal
is tantamount to such an admission.”</p>

<p>Mr. Clutch hurriedly passed to the witness-box
and urged his client not to withdraw.</p>

<p>Tempest’s voice was clear above the
racket and bustle in the court. “I object
to anyone tampering with the witness.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_300a"><img class="w100" src="images/i_300a.jpg" alt="I object to anyone tampering with the witness">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“‘I object to anyone tampering with the witness’”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“No—no. She has a right to take counsel
with her advisers on such a matter as a
withdrawal of her claim. You mustn’t
forget, Mr. Tempest, she has practically
admitted there is some secret of hers mixed
up in this matter. You yourself have suggested
it is a secret that Sir John created
this trust to obviate the disclosure of, and
you have practically threatened the witness
with a disclosure of her secret, if she continues
her claim. She may well prefer to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
forfeit a just claim rather than have it disclosed;
and, Mr. Tempest, I must remind
you I shall not permit any disclosure of a
matter which is entirely irrelevant to the
issue for the mere purpose of harassing the
witness.”</p>

<p>“As your lordship pleases. I could
have hoped, my lord, that you would not
have thought such a warning necessary to
me.”</p>

<p>As Tempest finished speaking there was
a momentary hush, and Clutch was heard
to say, “I tell you he’s simply bluffing.
He often does. Very likely it’s only waste-paper.”</p>

<p>A few whispered words passed between
the solicitor and the K. C., and the latter
rose, and said, “My client does not withdraw,
my lord.”</p>

<p>Tempest calmly broke the remaining
seals, and in the dead silence every eye
watched him as he took the papers one by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
one from the packet and unfolded them.
The first two were obviously Somerset
House certificates. The next was a buff-coloured
piece of tissue-paper—obviously
the press-copy of a letter. With a cursory
glance that also was laid aside. The last
remaining paper was a letter which Tempest
read through as the court waited. Refolding
it he slipped the papers back into
the parcel, and resumed his cross-examination.</p>

<p>“Lady Rellingham, I will ask you
again, were not the letter and the other paper
you produce given to Evangeline Stableford?”</p>

<p>“They were not.”</p>

<p>“How did they come into your possession?”</p>

<p>“Sir John gave them to me himself with
his own hands.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you take them from the dead
body of Evangeline Stableford?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>“Don’t answer. I object to such a question,
my lord,” said Mr. Barnett.</p>

<p>“I think you must take your answer, Mr.
Tempest,” replied the judge.</p>

<p>“As your lordship pleases. What was
your occupation, Lady Rellingham, at the
time of your marriage?”</p>

<p>“I had a situation at a milliner’s.”</p>

<p>“Lady Rellingham, when did you go on
the stage? Weren’t you on the stage when
you married?”</p>

<p>And in a whisper the admission came.</p>

<p>“Now, wasn’t your stage name Eulalie
Alvarez?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And your sister Dorothy Manuel was
Dolores Alvarez?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Now, when your husband heard of
your engagement to Lord Madeley, didn’t
he object strongly and threaten to make
your marriage to him public?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And didn’t you tell him that you were
about to have a child, and that it wouldn’t
be possible for you to marry Lord Madeley,
and that, taking advantage of Lord
Madeley’s inexperience of women, you and
your sister had arranged that, though Eulalie
Alvarez was engaged to him, it was
Dolores Alvarez who was going to go
through the ceremony of marriage with
Lord Madeley in the name of Eulalie Alvarez?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“So that, when Dolores Alvarez was
found dead, Sir John Rellingham thought
it was his wife who was dead, and troubled
no more, and stopped the allowance. Isn’t
that so?”</p>

<p>And without waiting for a reply Tempest
went on:</p>

<p>“Now, then, are you Sarah Jane Manuel—Eulalie
Alvarez—Lady Rellingham?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
or are you Dorothy Manuel—Dolores Alvarez—Lady
Madeley?”</p>

<p>“I’m Lady Rellingham—Eulalie.”</p>

<p>“Then it was Lady Madeley—Dolores—who
died, and you have been living all
these years masquerading as Lady Madeley?
Isn’t that so?”</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>“That was the secret Sir John tried to
protect for you?”</p>

<p>Again there was no answer.</p>

<p>“Now, once again I ask you: Was not
the letter you have produced given to
Evangeline Stableford, and wasn’t the
trust created for her benefit?”</p>

<p>Tempest hesitated, and then sat down;
but the witness had fainted. Barnett, K.
C., rose, and remarked that he felt he had
no alternative consistent with the dignity of
his profession but to retire from the case,
and his junior did the same. The judge
adjourned, and the court slowly emptied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>With a grave face Tempest returned to his
chambers.</p>

<p>Baxter and Marston joined him in the
corridor, and the three men walked in silence
across New Square.</p>

<p>“Come along in. I know a great deal
more than you do, and I’m at my wits’ end
what to do,” said the barrister. Handing
his wig and gown to his clerk he lighted a
cigarette, and backwards and forwards he
paced along the narrow pathway across his
carpet.</p>

<p>“I ought to have done it, but I simply
couldn’t. Very few people in court could
know all the facts. It’s simply a coincidence
that all of them happen to have come
into my hands. The chances can be only
one in a thousand that such a thing could
happen. The two Manuel girls were the
two sisters Alvarez, and to-day Lady Rellingham
has given the explanation of the
whole thing. Do you remember the suicide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
of Dolores Alvarez twenty years
ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember something of it. It
was a nine days’ wonder at the time.”</p>

<p>“That’s Dolores,” said Tempest, as he
pointed to the painted miniature over the
mantelpiece. “I was in that case, and it
has always puzzled me. You remember
she was found dead in her flat—stark nude
on the bed, and by the side an opened bottle
of champagne, with prussic acid in the
glass? The evidence was that her sister,
Lady Madeley, called; that she sent her
maid out; that the maid came back, found
Lady Madeley gone, and her mistress at
once sent her out again, and the maid came
back to find the dead body of Dolores. The
coroner’s verdict was suicide. Now, I’ve
puzzled over that for twenty years. Then
comes the death of Evangeline Stableford—the
body found nude at the Charing
Cross Hotel, and again the opened bottle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
of champagne and prussic acid; and then
there was the utterly marvellous likeness
between Dolores and Evangeline. But
they could not be mother and daughter, for
Dolores had never had a child, and I had
always assumed Evangeline could not be
the daughter of Lady Madeley, because
she was born on the day Lord and Lady
Madeley were married. It never dawned
on me that the two sisters changed places.”</p>

<p>“But, even if they did, you can’t make
it fit. Look here——”</p>

<p>“My dear Baxter, it does fit. They
changed places, and then changed back
again. I’d thought of the possibility of
one change; it never dawned on me that
there were two changes. This is what
happened: Eulalie married Sir John,
and keeps her marriage secret, and Sir
John makes her an allowance. His father
was alive then, and probably didn’t approve
of actresses. Then she gets engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
to Lord Madeley, for I daresay Rellingham
wasn’t much catch then. Now, she
can’t marry Lord Madeley—that would be
bigamy; and she’s just going to have a
child, so she persuades her sister Dolores
to go through the ceremony in her place
and in her name; and I have no doubt
whatever that the arrangement was that
Eulalie was to take the place of Lady
Madeley when the honey-moon was over.
I knew Lord Madeley, and it would have
been quite possible with him. He never
noticed the difference between one woman
and another.</p>

<p>“Now, Sir John Rellingham hears of
the engagement and protests. Eulalie
tells him of the expected child, and explains
that it is her sister who is really to
marry Lord Madeley, and that it was arranged
that she would marry him in the
name of Eulalie Alvarez. That being
merely an assumed name, one sister has no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
greater right to it than the other. So Sir
John was content, for, of course, he wouldn’t
be told the sisters intended to change places
after the marriage. Well, the marriage
does take place, and Eulalie’s child Evangeline
is born and adopted by Lady Stableford.
Then Lord and Lady Madeley
come back from the honey-moon, and Eulalie,
of course, wants her sister to stand
down and carry out the arrangement they
had come to. Dolores, who has found her
feet, very naturally objects. Then she
goes to tea with her sister. The maid sees
the two sisters together, and is sent out on
an errand. Eulalie poisons Dolores in the
bedroom. The maid comes back, is told
Lady Madeley has gone, and is at once sent
out again. Then Eulalie strips the body
of Dolores, and puts those clothes on. She
leaves her own clothes in the bedroom, because
she cannot dress the dead body in
them. From that moment she becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
Lady Madeley, and she leaves the flat before
the maid returns. She bears Lord
Madeley a child, the present Consuelo,
Baroness Madeley. Lord Madeley dies.
Lady Madeley has a small jointure, but she
has a handsome allowance for the maintenance
of Consuelo, and has the use of
Madeley Manor. Consuelo will be of age
in a year’s time, and Eulalie’s income
would be reduced to her jointure. Consuelo,
I hear, is engaged already, so there was
no chance of staving off the drop to the
jointure. Sir John, believing his wife was
dead, later on marries again. Now Sir
John, as time goes by, discovers that his
first wife, whom he had thought was dead,
is really alive, and masquerading as Lady
Madeley. He ought to have shown her
up at once, but he hesitates to do so, because
not only does it lay his wife open to
a charge of fraud and probable imprisonment,
but it also bastardises Consuelo and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
creates a huge scandal, and, moreover, it is
a slur on the memory of his second wife, to
whom he was very devoted. Added to all,
it means that he himself has committed
bigamy. So he lets things slide. Then
Lady Stableford quarrels with Evangeline,
and alters her will, and Sir John realises
that somehow or other he must provide for
his daughter. He therefore creates the secret
trust, knowing that if he puts everything
in your hands in that way he can trust
his wife’s secret not to be revealed, if this
can possibly be avoided; but he is so loyal
that even to you he won’t reveal it, unless
this becomes absolutely unavoidable. If
he hadn’t been murdered, none of this
would ever have come out. Then, knowing
he was going to be operated upon
whilst Evangeline was still a minor, he
sends to Lady Madeley to come to his office,
and he sends for Evangeline. He
gives that paper and letter to Evangeline,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
but tells her she is not to use it if Lady Stableford
provides for her. But if he himself
dies before she comes of age, and if
Lady Stableford does not provide for her,
then she is to use it, unless, to obviate the
risk of her secret being disclosed, Lady
Madeley, her mother, prefers to make the
necessary provision. He probably tells
them in each other’s presence, so as to give
each the hold on the other. But Lady
Madeley, knowing she will be reduced to
her jointure in a year or two, or else trying
to avert the disclosure, or in temper, kills
Sir John. I fancy it must have been a
right down quarrel, and she probably
killed him in temper, though the use of the
revolver looks as if she had planned it out
beforehand. It may have been that she
was fond of Consuelo, and was willing to
sacrifice anything to prevent her succession
being interfered with or jeopardised. Sir
John may have threatened her with disclosure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
or she may have shot him to stop his
speaking. Anyhow, she kills him, and
then it dawns on her that she is at the
mercy of Evangeline, who knows she has
killed him. So she determines to murder
Evangeline. She remembers that Dolores’
death was put down to suicide, and
the nude body was used as an argument to
suggest insanity. So she lays her plans,
takes a room at Charing Cross Hotel, and
entices Evangeline there, and poisons her.
She takes away her clothes, to prevent or
delay a discovery of the identity of the
body, and to suggest insanity, forgetting all
the time that at an hotel the absence of any
clothes in the room would establish the
complicity of another person. She finds
the letter from Sir John in the pocket of
Evangeline, and appropriates it. As soon
as I had stated in court that the directions
to your partners had been destroyed, she
sees her chance, and, knowing her income
will very shortly be reduced, and relying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
on this letter, she brings the action against
you three. As to the other paper, very
likely Clutch &amp; Holdem wrote that out,
and were responsible for that part of the
story. Now, that’s the whole explanation
of everything.”</p>

<p>“Shall you tell the police, Tempest?”</p>

<p>“No, old man. I don’t hunt murderers
for a living. The police read the papers.
If they like to put two and two together,
from what came out in court to-day, let
them. It’s not my business or yours.”</p>

<p>“Would she be convicted?”</p>

<p>“I doubt it. I’m certain of what I’ve
told you; but there’s too much deduction
for a jury. A jury will only convict for
murder on cold-drawn facts, and plenty of
them. But that woman will save them the
trouble. Unless they’ve arrested her already,
I expect she’ll commit suicide before
the morning. She’s shown up to the
world—utterly discredited. She isn’t Lady
Madeley, and consequently she hasn’t got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
any income now. And she knows what the
chances are, that she’ll be arrested for murder.
You’ll see she won’t risk it.”</p>

<p>“Then Consuelo isn’t Lady Madeley
either?”</p>

<p>“As it happens, she is, because I happen
to know that her trustees very wisely got
letters patent of confirmation when she succeeded.
It only means that Billy Fitz
Aylwyn succeeds to the old barony, whilst
the girl gets a new peerage, dating from
her patent.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The next morning the daily papers announced
that during the passage of the
Dover-Calais boat a lady passenger had
been missed. The unclaimed luggage left
behind proved her to have been Eulalie,
Lady Madeley.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Some six weeks later, Tempest received
a letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Tempest</span>,—In thinking
things over quietly, I have come to the
conclusion that you probably knew a great
deal more than you made public at the
trial. If I am right, I am grateful to you,
though you left me no alternative but to
leave England at once. If you will do one
generous action, you will do another.
Evangeline I never knew or cared about;
Consuelo is and was the delight of my life.
Will you, whatever happens, whatever
comes out, please do everything that is possible
for her? She has no one to guard her
now, for, as an illegitimate child, she has
not inherited the property, and so the trustees
who have been acting are not really
her trustees at all. Will you please do what
you can to straighten out the tangle I have
made? You will never hear of me again.
I am going to Australia, to earn my living,
and start again, if I can. If I cannot, then
in reality I shall end it, as the world already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
thinks I have done. Please don’t
try to find me.</p>

<p>“Now, for the last time I sign myself by
the name to which I have no right.—Yours,
<span class="smcap">Eulalie Madeley</span>.”</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Sometimes things straighten themselves
out without much outside interference.
Billy Fitz Aylwyn preferred to waive his
own claims in view of the realisation of his
great desire. Let the <i>Times</i> tell the conclusion
of the story.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
